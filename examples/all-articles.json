      "body": "\n## What is the AEIOU Observation Framework about?\n\n<a href=\"https://thedesignexchange.org\" target=\"_blank\">TheDesignExchange.org</a> put together a really great video quickly describing the AEIOU Observation Framework in less than one minute, so please take a look by clicking the image below:\n\n[![AEIOU, The Design Exchange Video](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uvvd6pcNX84/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvvd6pcNX84)\n\nThat video says it all but for reference AEIOU stands for:\n\n> **A - Activities**\\\n> **E - Environments**\\\n> **I - Interactions**\\\n> **O - Objects**\\\n> **U - Users**\n\nThis heuristic framework provides an observation technique used to document contextual inquiries during ethnographic studies. For the purposes of digital product and software practices, AEIOU is helpful for categorizing and interpreting observations gathered during user research field studies and usability testing efforts.\n\nThe acronym AEIOU provides an easy to recall mnemonic for how to observe qualitative research, it also quickly turns raw notes into categories that can inform research analysis to develop key insights and other findings.\n\n## Why use AEIOU?\n\nAEIOU relates to five heuristic categories to be observed and documented during user interviews, which provides a guideline for how to capture research data. This outline quickly defines each category:\n\n* **Activities:** What actions and behaviors are people taking to reach goals?\n* **Environments:** What is the overall setting in which the activities are taking place? How are people behaving in the environment?\n* **Interactions:** What are the basic interactions occurring for people to reach goals? What effect do people have on activities and environment?\n* **Objects:** What are all the details that form the environment? How do objects relate to people, activities and interactions?\n* **Users:** Who are the people being observed? What are their personalities like? How do they engage with other people to reach goals? \n\nAEIOU is a starting point for research efforts, the above category definitions can be iterated upon and refined to align with project goals. [Rick E. Robinson](https://www.epicpeople.org/building-a-useful-research-tool/), creator of AEIOU, calls it a “categorizing heuristic” which can be modified.\n\n## How to conduct a contextual inquiry using AEIOU?\n\nAEIOU provides a template for observing contextual inquiries and collecting qualitative data. Simply use the framework to create a worksheet which can be taken in the field for researchers to utilize. It will help gather observational data in addition to other ethnographic methods such as audio, photos and video.\n\nThe worksheet design can be a simple word processing document with added space to take notes in each section, or organized with columns similar to a spreadsheet like this example: \n\n![AEIOU Column Worksheet ](/images/aeiou_worksheet.jpg)\n\nThe worksheet can also be designed in a fun way like this empathy map example: \n\n![AEIOU Empathy Map https://www.creatlr.com/template/1knjaTEkdFHvtBOLr8DAx/aeiou-empathy-map/](/images/aeiou-empathy-map.png)\n\n## How to use AEIOU as a methodology?\n\nWhile AEIOU was not necessarily created to inform methodology it can also provide a guideline for conducting user research. \n\nSometimes with exploratory studies that have lengthy technically specific discussion guides, the data collection is often broad and later analysis will define the categories of information. In this case, AEIOU can be used as a method for aligning a team upon the heuristic observation strategy and planning research data collection. \n\n**PRO TIP:** Include a section on the discussion guide cover page with a quick overview of what to look for. This is a helpful reminder for observers and note takers about responsibilities during a user interview session. These bullets are a good example of what to include and can be modified or added to for alignment with project goals:\n\n* AEIOU Framework (Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, Users)\n* Capture what you see (participant’s body language, artifacts used, etc.)\n* Capture what you hear in their words (quotes, stories, keywords, contradictions, etc.)\n* Capture what you feel that the user is feeling (emotions, beliefs, confusion, passion, etc.)\n\n## Facilitation Notes\n\n**Prerequisite Knowledge**\\\nSome idea of the research goals is helpful.\n\n**Deliverable**\\\nThe worksheets will be used to include in research analysis activities.\n\n**Supply list:**\\\n\n* AEIOU Worksheet\\\n* Printer\n\n## Resource Links\n\n* [Building a Useful Research Tool: An Origin Story of AEIOU](https://www.epicpeople.org/building-a-useful-research-tool/)\n* [AEIOU Framework](https://help.ethnohub.com/guide/aeiou-framework)\n* [Free Column Worksheet](http://www.libraryuxtoolkit.com/search.html#flyOnTheWall)\n* [Free Empathy Map Worksheet](https://www.creatlr.com/template/1knjaTEkdFHvtBOLr8DAx/aeiou-empathy-map/)\n\n## Related Practices\n\n* [Empathy Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/empathy-mapping/)\n\n##\n",

      "title": "Affinity Mapping",
      "subtitle": "Identify insights, patterns and trends in research and ideas",
      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nAffinity Mapping is a practice used to organize ideas or insights. It allows large numbers of ideas  stemming from brainstorming to be sorted into groups, based on their natural relationships, for review and analysis. It is also frequently used in contextual inquiry as a way to organize notes and insights from field interviews for synthesis and analysis. Additionally, it can be used for organizing freeform comments, such as open-ended survey responses, support call logs, or other qualitative data.\n\nHere's a quick intro video:\\\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UynxDyr0lAo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Why use it?\n\nMost of us are familiar with brainstorming—a method by which a group generates as many ideas around a topic as possible in a limited amount of time. Brainstorming works to get a high quantity of information on the table. But it begs the follow-up question of how to gather meaning from all the data. \n\nUsing a simple Affinity Diagram technique can help us discover embedded patterns (and sometimes break old patterns) of thinking by sorting and clustering language-based information into relationships. It can also give us a sense of where most people’s thinking is focused. \n\nUse an affinity diagram when you want to find categories and meta-categories within a cluster of ideas and when you want to see which ideas are most common within a group.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. If you are brainstorming ideas, clearly state the objective of the brainstorm (a [How Might We statement](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/hmw/) or Problem Statement). If you are synthesizing research data, collect all data and write each observation/data point on a separate sticky.\n2. Have the group post them on a flat working surface visible to everyone. \n3. Based on guidance from the players, move related stickies next to each other to start forming clusters based on relationships. Involve the group in the process as much as possible. Have the players approach the wall to post their notes—it saves time—and allows them to do an initial, general sorting in columns or clusters. When done, it should look something like this:\n4. Create a sticky-note “parking lot” close to the display for ideas that don’t appear to fall into a natural category. Redundancy in ideas is OK; don’t discard sticky notes because they’re already represented. It’s helpful to leave repeated ideas posted since it indicates to the group how many people are thinking the same thing. At this stage, ask the players to try to avoid searching for higher categories and simply to focus on grouping the information based on the affinities.\n5. Once the content is sorted, ask the group to suggest categories that represent the columns you’ve created and write the categories they agree on at the top of the column (or near a cluster if you chose a cluster rather than a column display). Don’t let the players spend an inordinate amount of time agreeing on a name for a category. If there’s disagreement over “Facilities” versus “Infrastructure,” write them both. If the players produce categories that are significantly different, pay attention to which category gets the most approval from the group and write that one. Once done, you might have something that looks like this:\n\n![](/images/screen-shot-2019-10-24-at-2.25.16-pm.png)\n\n## Further Information\n\n* [Detailed post from the Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/affinity-diagrams-learn-how-to-cluster-and-bundle-ideas-and-facts)\n* [Detailed steps and tips from General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/design/user-experience-design/affinity-mapping)\n* [Affinity Mapping on Gamestorming.com](https://gamestorming.com/affinity-map/)\n* [Time Lapse video of Affinity Mapping Exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFXBI5NguYk)\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nThe Agile Agenda is a simple yet effective way to manage the agenda for an in-person workshop using sticky notes and a whiteboard. The basic idea is to draw a days calendar on a whiteboard, then split it into two or more tracks. After that, write agenda items on sticky notes (with owners!) and then place them on the whiteboard in the correct time slot. Review your agenda in the morning, and then come back to it throughout the day, updating it as needed. It should look something like this:\n\n![agile agenda](/images/agile_agenda.png)\n\n## Why use an Agile Agenda?\n\n* Sessions like [event storming](/practice/event-storming/) or [user story mapping](/practice/user-story-mapping/) don't neatly fit into time boxes. Therefore you need to manage dynamically your agenda.\n* Whiteboards and sticky notes are easier to change than digital agendas which might need some formatting or even have access issues.\n* It works as an Information Radiator[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) throughout the workshop, making it a logical area to gather the team to review the agenda as well as do time checks. Compare this to an agenda captured in a slide deck, which doesn't naturally lead to a team huddle.\n\n## Related Practices\n\n* Collaborative Face Drawing[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2) is a great ice breaker or after lunch activity. Your agile agenda can be a nice home for the faces once the activity is over as seen below:\n\n![agenda with faces](/images/agenda_with_faces.png)\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\n* Whiteboard that can hold sticky notes.\n* Whiteboard markers.\n* Sticky notes (preferably a wide variety).\n\n## External References\n\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>[Information Radiator](http://scrumbook.org/value-stream/information-radiator.html) on ScrumBook.org.\n2. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>[Collaborative Face Drawing](http://www.funretrospectives.com/collaborative-face-drawing/).\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nAutoscaling is a method of changing amount of computing resources based on the applications measured load. This load could be CPU, memory, network or some other measurable metric that can be used as the trigger of scaling. The metric could also be the amount of items in a message queue or the amount of tasks waiting in your business process. It can be used with active backends or batch job type of temporary workloads.\n\nAutoscaling can also be used as an automatic recovery for failed application instances. Because when coupled with health checks, auto scale can kill or restart the non-operational instance of the app and automatically replace it with a new working one.\n\nLoad balancing is also closely linked to autoscaling as you will need the ability to dynamically add and remove application instances from load balancing.\n\n## Why use it?\n\nIt allows the application to only consume resources when needed. This is important, especially in cloud environments where your operational costs are based on usage. It also enables other practices such as rolling upgrades or easy rollbacks because autoscaling applications by default must have the capability to operate stateless or some way to synchronise all instances automatically.\n\nAutoscaling can be used on to spin up working nodes to process batch jobs based on tasks in a queue. This enables you to process the tasks or messages on demand much better than with static application.\n\nThis practice also enables better uptime and availability of your application via the health checks and reaction to actual load. So when you get an unexpected amount of traffic coming in, or when the application crashes in certain corner cases, the autoscaling can react and bring more working and available instances of your application.\n\n## Further Information\n\n* [Wikipedia definition of Autoscaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoscaling)\n* [AWS Auto scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/)\n* [OpenShift Pod Autoscaling](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html)\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nPremortem is an analytical / thought experiment technique, which is frequently used for risk management, strategic or product decision evaluation.\n\nTo apply it a group of people is brought together to a meeting. In that meeting, almost as a game, people have to imagine a point in the future where the project has drastically failed and think up different reasons why that might have happened.\n\nThe method originates from Gary Klein (HBR article) and was made popular by the Nobel price winner Daniel Kahneman in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow”.\n\nThe approach is really simple and transports the team in the distant future in which the product would be launched and failed miserably. The team is asked to describe the reasons, the root causes really, behind the notorious failure.\n\nThe practice is very similar to the black hat in the Six Thinking Hats brainstorming approach or the [News Headlines](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/news-headlines-aka-cover-story/). The News Headlines is a really a variation of the premortem practice using visual facilitation.\n\n## Why use it?\n\nThe method is simple, fast and cheap to execute. You do not need to prime the group or invest in any upfront training.\n\nIt is a great way to identify risks and threats, which can be later addressed, e.g. through early experiments or other actions.\n\nThe benefits of this method when making important product decisions:\n\n* Eliminates groupthink\n* Overcomes blind spots - as planning far ahead tends to introduce risks of overlooking details\n* A psychologically safe way to surface disagreements on important details of the product design - often in lack of psychological safety, people would not point out gaps or deficiencies in the design to avoid appearing as pessimists or getting in a debate over the relevance of their concerns\n\n## Related Practices\n\nThis practice complements nicely [Start at the End](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/start-at-the-end/), [Whole Product Plotting](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/whole-product-plotting/), [Design the box](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-the-box/), [News Headlines](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/news-headlines-aka-cover-story/) and any other product design practice.\n\nIt can provide a good approach for [retrospectives](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/retrospectives/) too.the\n\n## Origin\n\n* Gary Klein\n* Daniel Kahneman\n\n## Further Information\n\n[Premortem on Gamestorming.com ](https://gamestorming.com/pre-mortem/)\n\n[Thinking Fast And Slow, Daniel Kahneman](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Daniel-Kahneman-2011-10-25/dp/B01FIYNOKU/)\n\n[Daniel Kahneman explaining Premortem in a 3 min video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzTNMalfyhM)\n\n[Gary Klein HBR, Performing a project premortem](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem)\n\nImage credit: Photo by [Matt Botsford](https://unsplash.com/photos/wxuPH6QRvJc) on Unsplash\n",

The other environment, let’s call it “blue” is a copy upgraded to a new version. \n\n![Blue Green Deployment](/images/blue-green.jpg \"Blue Green Deployment\")\n\nThe team can perform all required task for an upgrade of the product version on the “blue” environment without the rush of downtime. Once the “blue” environment is ready, past all kind of smoke tests and checks, the team simply redirects the reverse proxy (load balancer/router) to point to the “blue” environment. \n\nIf everything works fine with the “blue” environment, the now outdated “green” can be used to serve as the “blue” for the next release. If things go bad the team can switch back to a stable environment instantly using the reverse proxy/load balancer/router.\n\n## Why use it?\n\nThis is a feedback loop practice, which allows the team to get prompt feedback from real life use of their changes.

In case of adverse effects, it allows the teams to have an instant roll back alternative and limit the negative impact on customers.\n\n## Related Practices\n\n[Feature Toggles](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/feature-toggles/)\n\n[Canary Deployment ](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/canary-release/)\n\n[Dark Launches](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/dark-launches/)\n\n[Continuous Delivery](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/continuous-delivery/)\n\n## Further information\n\n[Blue-green Deployments, A/B Testing, and Canary Releases](http://blog.christianposta.com/deploy/blue-green-deployments-a-b-testing-and-canary-releases/) by Christian Posta\n\n[BlueGreen Deployments](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html) by Martin Fowler\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nA burndown chart is a visualisation of work left to do within a specified time period. The remaining work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. \n\nTeams often use burndown charts to track progress within fixed time periods (for example, Sprint Burndown charts). They can also be used to visualise progress for longer time periods and milestones (for example, Release Burndown charts).\n\n## Why use a Burndown chart?\n\nBurndown charts provide real data about a team's velocity and provides a mechanism as to whether the team's current velocity and trajectory will result in it meeting its committed goal(s).\n\n## Related Practices\n\n[Retrospectives](/practice/realtime-retrospective/) provide excellent opportunities to review recent burndown charts and to facilitate conversations on what can be learned from the data presented in them. \n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\n* A large piece of flip-chart paper - ideally with gridded lines.\n* Flip chart pens\n* Long ruler\n\n## How Do I do it?\n\n* Draw a horizonatal and vertical lines on the flip-chart\n* Mark the horizontal axis with the time measurement (for a Sprint Burndown, this is likely to be each day in the Sprint)\n* Mark the vertical axis with the work being measured (this may be number of tasks, number of stories/features, number of story points or estimated time)\n* Draw a diagonal line connecting the maximum work units to the last time measurement - this line represents the target/aspirational trend line\n* As work is complete, draw a line (in a differnt color) representing the time point the remaining work has 'burned down' and how much work is remaining\n* Re-visit and discuss what information the chart is radiating with the team and interested stakeholders.\n\n![Example Sprint Burndown](/images/burndown.png)\n\n## External References\n\n1.

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nIn software development, this is a form of Continuous Delivery in which only a small part of the real users of a product will be exposed to the new version of the product. The team would monitor for regressions, performance issues and other adverse effects and can easily move users back to the working old version if issues are spotted. \n\nThe term comes from the use of caged birds in coal mines to discover the build up of dangerous gases early on. The gases would kill the bird long before they become life threatening for the miners. As with the canary in the mine, this release practice provides an early warning mechanism for avoiding bigger issues. \n\n## Why use it?\n\nThis is a feedback loop practice, which allows the team to get prompt feedback from real life use of their changes. It enables the [Continuous Delivery](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/continuous-delivery/). \n\nThe Canary Release provides continuous delivery teams with safety by enabling them to perform a phased roll-out, gradually increasing the number of users on a new version of a product. While rolling out the new version, the team will be closely monitoring the performance of the platform and try to understand the impacts of the new version and assess the risks for adverse effects as regressions, performance, even downtime. This approach allows the team to “roll-back” the release as soon as such adverse effects are observed without the majority of the customers being impacted even for a limited amount of time.\n\n## Related Practices\n\nCanary Release is similar to [A/B Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/) in the sense that it is only exposing a part of the population to the new feature, but unlike [A/B Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/), the new feature can and is typically a completely new feature and not just a small tweak of an existing one. The purpose is different too. [A/B Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/) is looking to improve the product performance in terms of getting business outcomes, while the Canary release is focus entirely on the technical performance. \n\nCanary Release is similar to the [Dark Launch](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/dark-launches/) as they both expose only part of the population to a feature. The [Dark Launch](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/dark-launches/) is focused on understanding the way users will react and use the new feature, while Canary Release is really focused on the technical performance of the changed product or the individual feature (if using a it can be isolated in the architecture).\n\nFeature toggles are an enabling practice, which allows for Canary Releases to be implemented in existing products. \n\nFeature Toggles\n\n[Dark Launches ](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/dark-launches/)\n\n[Blue/Green Deployment](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/blue-green-deployments/)\n\n[Continuous Delivery](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/continuous-delivery/)\n\n## Further information\n\n[Blue-green Deployments, A/B Testing, and Canary Releases](http://blog.christianposta.com/deploy/blue-green-deployments-a-b-testing-and-canary-releases/) by Christian Posta\n\n[Canary Release](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html) by Martin Fowler\n\nImage credit: Photo by [Julia Craice](https://unsplash.com/photos/o0S-0Pa4F2M) on Unsplash\n",

      "subtitle": "Demonstrate the value of open organization principles like collaboration and transparency",
      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nThe \"Candy or Swag?\" practice uses a game environment to reinforce critical [open organization values like collaboration and transparency](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-org-definition).  The goal is to demonstrate how that, even in the simplest group scenarios, outcomes improve for everyone when members of self-organizing teams collaborate and hold each other accountable for results.  \n\n## Why use it?\n\nWhen new teams are forming, especially in traditional organizations with siloed legacies, there is a need to establish open organization values like collaboration and transparency.  This practice delivers these messages in an engaging game environment.\n\nIn addition, if your organization distributes swag like team or project t-shirts when embarking on a new initiative, this practice provides a much more memorable delivery experience than simply leaving an open box in a conference room.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. Candy:  Enough individual pieces of candy for each participant for the number of game rounds expected.  Example:  10 participants * 5 rounds = 50 pieces of candy.  Note that it doesn't have to be candy.  It could be any item expected to be of significantly lower value to the participants than the Swag.\n2. Swag:  1 piece of swag per student (plus spares).  This is the higher value prize.  Possibilities include t-shirts, phone chargers, pens, etc.\n3. Cards:  2 index cards per student.  One card says \"Candy\"; the other says \"Swag\".\n\n## Steps\n\nThe game proceeds through multiple sets of rounds, each of which is used in illustrating open organization principles.\n\n### Phase 1:  Control\n\nFirst, explain the rules of the game.  \n1. NO TALKING.  If you talk, you get neither Candy nor Swag.\n2. You have two cards in front of you.  For each round, choose either the Candy or Swag card and show only me your choice as I walk around the room.\n3. Here's how we determine who gets what:\n\n| SCENARIO | WHO GETS CANDY? | WHO GETS SWAG?  | SUMMARY |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Everyone chooses Candy | EVERYONE  | NO ONE | Everyone wins a little. |\n| Only 1 chooses Swag | EVERYONE but Swag chooser | Swag chooser ONLY | Everyone wins a little.  Someone wins a lot. |\n| More than 1 choose Swag | NO ONE | NO ONE | Everyone loses. |\n\nNOTE:  For larger groups, you may want to increase the number of allowable Swag choosers per round.  See the slide set referenced below for recommended guidelines.\n\nWhat typically happens in Phase 1 is that multiple people will choose Swag in each round, so no one gets anything.  Run at least two rounds in this phase to build some frustration among the group.  Allow some reflection at the end of this phase where you compare this to a typical project development process, where cross-functional expertise is locked in organizational silos that seldom or never communicate with one another.\n\n### Phase 2:  Collaboration\n\nReview the principles of open source and ask if communication might help everyone achieve better outcomes.  Phase 2 adds an element of collaboration to the game.  \n\nAnnounce that the group will have one minute from when I say \"go\" to collaborate before you choose CANDY or SWAG. I'll hold up signs telling you when you have 30 seconds left, then 20 seconds left, then count down the last ten.  Then the game proceeds exactly as before.\n\nThis is where things get interesting.  I've seen groups attempt to establish some sharing protocol to ensure that someone gets swag every round:  randomly, according to need, alphabetical order of names, etc.  Sometimes it works; often it doesn't.\n\nRun at least 2-3 rounds in this phase.  If the group figures out how to cooperate by this point, you can add another variant by having a pre-planted \"bad actor\" in the group.  Activate the \"bad actor\" secretly for a final round and watch the frustration build again.\n\nIn the reflection on this phase, the group will generally agree that collaboration produced better results for everyone.  However, a lone \"bad actor\" could still ruin the outcomes for everyone. Solicit ideas on ways the sabotage could be prevented.  That should provide a segue into the final Transparency phase of the game.\n\n### Phase 3:  Transparency\n\nPhase 3 proceeds by allowing everyone a minute to collaborate as before.  But this time, the choice of Candy or Swag cards is not hidden from the group.  Instead, when the GO signal is given, everyone places their card face-up on the table.\n\nReflect on how the combination of collaboration and transparency achieved better outcomes for everyone.  Those are two of the core principles we live by in open organizations.\n\n### Distribute the SWAG!\n\nFinally, distribute swag to everyone who hasn't already received it. \n\n## Further Information\n\n* [opensource.com blog post](https://opensource.com/education/16/6/candy-or-swag-game-teaching-open-source-kids) by [Gina Likins](https://opensource.com/users/lintqueen)\n* [Slide deck](./candy-or-swag-preso.pdf) adapted from Gina Likins' session at Red Hat Americas Tech Exchange 2019\n* Paper from University of North Texas by McPherson and Nieswiadomy: [\"Teaching the Prisoner's Dilemma More Effectively\"](https://itservices.cas.unt.edu/~mcpherson/papers/mcpherson_nieswiadomy_jee.pdf)## What is it?\n\n\n",

Celebrating failure is all about bringing the team together in an informal and safe environment, where team members can share stories of products that went wrong and the reasons why.  It can also be used during the development of a product if and when failures occur, so the collective team have awareness of the root causes.\n\nFailure root causes are written or drawn on large stickies, visible to the team throughout the product development for continuous reflection.\n\n## Why use it?\n\nThe primary benefit of this practice is to raise the team's collective awareness of these root causes, arming the team with real world stories for reference if and when they suspect a similar root cause developing.  Team members are therefore empowered to say that X action may lead to Y failure down the line, with a reference back to a root cause written on the wall.  Transparency of previous failures demonstrates honesty and courage, which builds trust across the team, sponsors and users.\n\n## How to do it?\n\nThe team gather in an informal and safe environment as part of the inception of a new product.  Team members have the opportunity to summarise failure root causes of their stories on large stickies.  They then take it in turns to share their stories, and attach their stickies to a highly visible board.  Team members can only share a story that they were a part of with first hand experience.  A suggested structure is to keep the sharing concise for each story, providing a brief context, the root cause, and the impact to the product.  Product Owners, Sponsors, Users are also welcomed to share their experiences of where products went wrong.\n\nIf and when new failures are identified throughout the product development, they are added to the board.  The team are brought back together to raise awareness.  This could be on the fly or part of the retrospective.\n",

A good way of imagining a container is a way of packaging up applications or services. The container will only contain the files and libraries required for that application or service and will share the underlying components such as the kernel. The package of files and libraries is known as a container image.\n\n## Why use it?\n\n* **Density** – Containers allow greater utilisation of infrastructure with multiple containers able to run on singular VMs or bare-metal servers.\n* **Portability** – The immutable container image can run in any environment that has the required container engine. This enables a hybrid cloud strategy.\n* **Speed** – A container image starts up very quickly, in most cases less than a second, as opposed to multiple minutes if not longer for a traditional system to boot up.\n* **DevSecOps Enabler** – Building an immutable container image allows for developers to develop only the application/service specific code while having the security team scan the image to ensure its compliance. Then the container image can be run by the operations team who will only require knowledge on running containers rather than application specific knowledge, thus enabling DevSecOps practices.\n\n## Further Information\n\n* [Understanding Linux containers](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers) by Red Hat.\n",

This practice builds on top of [Continuous Integration](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/continuous-integration/) and [Continuous Delivery](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/continuous-delivery/). As a result, the software configuration and deployment orchestration becomes part of the development team's duty.\n\n## Why use it?\n\n* The development team maintains deployable code and configuration over new features.\n* It enables fast feedback from end users.\n* Each feature can be pushed out after completion.\n* It enforces everything as code practices as configuration and deployment orchestration needs to be part of the automation.\n* It enables fast rollbacks and recovery from failures.\n\n## How to do it?\n\nThe practice needs close collaboration of everyone involved in deployment and delivery of the software to production. Everything related to the deployment needs to me automated as much as possible. As new features are pushed to production right away, the use of [feature toggles](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html) and [dark launches](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/dark-launches/) becomes important.\n\nContinuous Deployment also needs a good level of monitoring of the application. These monitors should be visualised so that changes to response times or error to success rates can be quickly spotted when new deployment is rolled out.\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nCrazy 8’s is a core Design Sprint method. It is a fast sketching exercise that challenges people to sketch eight distinct ideas in eight minutes. The goal is to push beyond your first idea, frequently the least innovative, and to generate a wide variety of solutions to your challenge.\n\nHere's a quick overview video:\\\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yz4g87XapQ0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Why use it? \n\nThis practice is a great way to ensure a product team is taking the time to prioritize user needs and generate enough solutions to needs to broaden the potential for finding the best idea. Often times, a team generates a solution and begins development right away without considering whether a solution is a good one. But “good” is a relative term, so ideally teams should be generating a myriad of product solutions in order to compare and contrast and allow the best option to emerge.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Give each participant a single sheet of printer paper and a sharpie\n2. Have participants fold their paper into eight sections (it should look like the paper in the header image for this post)\n3. Set the timer for eight minutes\n4. Each team member sketches one idea in each rectangle\n5. When the timer goes off, put your pens down\n6. Have team members spend 2 min presenting their 8 ideas to everyone\n\n## Follow-on Activities\n\nAfter the team presents ideas, you can run a [dot-voting exercise](http://www.funretrospectives.com/dot-voting/) to vote on which ideas and idea components the team likes the most. Afterwards, you can consolidate the ideas into a single idea to flesh out into a testable prototype.\n\n## Further Information\n\n* [Overview of Crazy 8s Exercise](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase3-sketch/crazy-eights)\n* [Alternative overview of Crazy 8s Exercise](https://www.iamnotmypixels.com/how-to-use-crazy-8s-to-generate-design-ideas/)\n",

      "subtitle": "Letting a small group of interested users test features before others",
      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nA continuous delivery practice, which allows you to release new features only to a group of users and invisible to others. The Dark Launch enables the team to understand the real life impact of new features, which may be unexpected for users in the sense that no users asked for them. These type of release allows the team to only expose a part of the user population to the new feature and carefully observe and measure the user interaction. It is one of the last steps for validating a product/market fit for new features. \n\n## Why use it?\n\nThis is a feedback loop practice, which allows the team to get prompt feedback from real life use of their changes. \n\nThe Dark Launch provides safety by limiting the impact of new features to only a subset of the users. It allows the team to build better understanding of the impact created by the new feature and the ways the users would interact with it. Often novel ways of interaction can surface, ways which were not initially envisioned by the team. This can be both positive and negative and the limited availability allows the team to draw conclusions from the real life use and make a decision on if the feature will be made widely available, further developed or discontinued. \n\n## Related Practices\n\nFeature toggles are an enabling practice, which allows for Dark Launches to be implemented in existing products. \n\nDark Launch is similar to [A/B Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/) in the sense that it is only exposing a part of the population to the new feature, but unlike [A/B Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/), the new feature can and is typically a completely new feature and not just a small tweak of an existing one. The purpose is different too as [A/B Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/) is looking to improve the product performance in terms of getting business outcomes from an existing feature, while the Dark Launch is often exploring the possibility to extend the market by adding new features.\n\nDark Launch is similar to the [Canary Release](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/canary-release/) as they both expose only part of the population to a feature. The Dark Launch is focused on understanding the way users will react and use the new feature, while [Canary Release](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/canary-release/) is really focused on the technical performance of the changed product or the individual feature (if using it can be isolated in the architecture).\n\n[Canary Deployment ](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/canary-release/)\n\n[Blue/Green Deployment](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/blue-green-deployments/)\n\n[Continuous Delivery](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/continuous-delivery/)\n\n## Further information\n\n\n\n## _**Improve this article:** We lack links to good explanations of the practice._\n\n\n\nImage credit: Photo by [Ben White](https://unsplash.com/photos/4Bs9kSDJsdc) on Unsplash\n",

It's a handful of practices you run in order with a group to identify pain points or problems to solve, prioritizing those problems, ideating solutions to the most important problems, prioritizing those solutions, then assigning next-steps for the team to take in order to run a solution experiment.\n\n## Why use it?\n\nThe Decision Jam is an insanely flexible combination of exercises, taking the best of the world’s problem-solving processes ([Design Thinking](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-design-thinking-and-why-is-it-so-popular)/[Gamestorming](https://gamestorming.com/)/[Design Sprints](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-sprint/)/[Agile](http://www.agilenutshell.com/) to name a few) and crushing them down to their absolute essence. It's great to use if you feel like your team either isn't currently focused on constant improvement OR you find the meetings you have about improving or problem solving never have any follow-through. Oh, or you're in a group where 1 or a few people tend the dominate the conversation! This helps ensure EVERYONE's ideas are considered 👏👏👏\n\nIt's awesome for converging on areas of improvement and driving to a clear experiment for a solution within a very short period of time. So if you wanna have fast follow-through for your team, this is a great workshop to try out!\n\n## Overview of Steps\n\n**1.** Identify the things that are working\n\n**2.** Capture all the problems or things holding the group back\n\n**3.** Prioritize those problems\n\n**4.** Reframe the problems as standardized challenges\n\n**5.** Ideate solutions to the problems without discussion\n\n**6.** Prioritise solutions\n\n**7.** Decide what solution to execute on\n\n**8.** Make solutions actionable\n\nHere's an step-by-step video of the creator of the Lightning Decision Jam (AJ&Smart) on how to facilitate this jazz:\\\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/33hBnZzoFAg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Further Information\n\n1.

      "title": "Design of Experiments",
      "subtitle": "Learn Fast, Move Even Faster",
      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nAll our ideas about new products, new services, new feature, any changes we can introduce to make things better (growth, revenue, experience, etc.) start as an idea, a hypothesis, an assumption. In traditional approaches one will place the bets based on some form of ROI analysis or investments analysis, making further assumptions in the process. The Design of Experiments is an alternative to this approach, in which we are trying to validate as many of those important ideas/hypothesis/assumptions as early as possible. Some of those object of experiments we may want to keep “open” until we get the real world proof, which can be done through Split Testing for example.\n\nThe Design of Experiments is the practice we use to turn ideas, hypothesis and/or assumptions into concrete well defined set of experiments which can be carried out in order to validate those ideas, hypothesis and assumptions, i.e. provide us with valuable learning. \n\nYou may need more than one experiment for each item (idea, hypothesis, assumption). An experiment usually only changes a small part of the product or service in order to understand how this change could influence our goals (Target Outcomes). The number of experiments is really defined based on what you want to learn and how many distinctive changes you will be introducing. \n\nLooking back after the experiment you want to be able to identify what worked and what did not. The analysis of the experiments is essentially used to drive the direction of the product/service you are building.  In other words the experiments are one of the mediums, which allow you to pivot. \n\nYou need data for this analysis and it can be both qualitative and quantitive. As in any analysis the quality of the data is critical for the quality of the conclusions and this quality is driven by the design of the experiment. When you design the experiment, you need to envision the ways you can measure outcomes, ways to collect the data, i.e. measurements methods. \n\nThe format of the experiment documentation is really not that important and there are multiple ideas about canvases you can find out there. It is the content that is important and how well you have designed the experiment, i.e. does it allow for many opportunities where the outcome is too ambiguous to judge.\n\nGood experiments need the following minimum details to be successful:\n\n* **Hypothesis**: formulated as a sentence, often expressing an assumption\n* **Current Condition**: What is the situation now (as measurable as possible)?\n* **Target Condition**: What are we trying to achieve (as measurable as possible)? \n* **Obstacles**: What could prevent us from achieving the target condition? What could cause interference or noise.\n* **Pass**: How can we define positive pass? The target condition may not always be achieved, then what do we consider a significant enough change to conclude the experiment is confirming the hypothesis, i.e. passing with positive outcome.\n* **Measures**: How shall we measure the progress?\n* **Learning**: Always capture outcomes and learning, which should ideally lead to more experiments of higher order\n\nOnce described those experiments are implemented, tracked and measured in order to analyse the outcomes. In an ideal world an experiment will have a binary success/fail criteria, but most often we would need to analyse data using statistical methods to find out if there is a significant correlation between the change introduced with the experiment and the change in the target outcome.\n\nNOTE: Successful experiments are not experiments that have proven our assumption as correct. Successful experiments are those that provide valid and reliable data which shows a statistically significant conclusion. \n\n## Why use it?\n\n* Design of Experiments is a fail safe way to advance a solution and learn fast\n* Design of Experiments can provide a quick way to evolve a product\n* Design of Experiments helps drive innovation in existing as well as new products\n* Design of Experiments enables autonomous team to deliver on leadership intent by placing small bets\n* Design of Experiments is essential for realising the Build-Measure-Learn loop\n\n## Why & How to combine it with other practices?\n\nDesign of experiment is nothing without execution, which is the main reason for combining this practice with others. \n\nExperiments need to be prioritized as we can only do so much in the time we have. Combining this practice with the various prioritisation matrices as [Effort-Impact](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-effort-prioritization-matrix/) or [How-Now-Wow](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/how-now-wow-prioritization-matrix/) helps a lot.\n\nExperiments are often realised first through Rapid Prototyping, Prototyping and are subject to User Research & Testing. This combination provides for fast learning even a single line of code is written. \n\nExperiments may be made in production as well. In fact, tests in production are the ultimate form of validation of ideas/hypothesis/assumptions as it is supported by real data or real customer actions. The Split Testing practice provides super valuable combination. \n\nOften you may have a set of experiments go through a sequence of Rapid Prototyping / Prototyping with User Research and then a subset of “successful” experiments would be carried forward to production to pass through Split Testing. \n\n## Related Practices\n\n* [Feature Toggles](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/feature-toggles/)\n* [Split Testing - A/B Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/)\n* [Split Testing - Multi-vari Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-multivari-testing/)\n* Prototyping / Pretotyping \n* Rapid Prototyping\n* User Research\n* User Testing\n* [HMW](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/hmw/) \n\n## Further information\n\n[Experiments Canvas](https://leanchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Lean-Change-Management-Experiment-Tracker-1.0.pdf) on LeanChange.org\n\n[Design of Experiments from Lean Six Sigma Perspective](https://www.moresteam.com/toolbox/design-of-experiments.cfm) on MoreSteam University  \n\nBook: [How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of \"Intangibles\" in Business](https://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business/dp/1452654204)\n",

It is a simple and cheap way to validate major assumptions, the Big question/s and point to the different options to explore further through delivery.\n\nThis set of practices reduces risks when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market. Design Sprints are the fastest way to find out if a product or project is worth undertaking, if a feature is worth the effort, or if your value proposition is really valid. For the latter one should also consider running a [Research Sprint](https://library.gv.com/the-gv-research-sprint-a-4-day-process-for-answering-important-startup-questions-97279b532b25). \n\nIt compresses work into one week and importantly tests the design idea and provides real user feedback in rapid fashion.\n\n## How to do a Design Sprint? - A Sample Agenda\n\nBy now there are many different variations of the format. You may come across the Google variation, a GV variation, the Design Sprint 2.0 (which is the agenda shown below). \n\nThe best is to try different variations and judge which one works for what context. \n\n### Monday\n\n* Intro\n* How Might We\n* Map\n* Lightning Demos\n* Notes Taking\n* Crazy 8's\n* Long Term Goals\n* Sprint Questions\n* Lightning Demos\n* Drawing Ideas\n* Start user test recruiting \n* Develop Concepts\n\n### Tuesday\n\n* Decide on Solution\n* Storyboard design\n* Decider Vote\n* Storyboard Final Walk-through \n* User test recruiting \n\n### Wednesday\n\n* Prototype creation\n* User test preparation\n* Interview room setup\n\n### Thursday\n\n* Testing with end-users\n* Analyse results and prepare findings\n\n### Friday\n\n* Showcase (demonstrate process & findings)\n\n\n## Related Practices\n\nResearch Sprint\n\n[Start At The End](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/start-at-the-end/) \n\n[Design The Box](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-the-box/)\n\n[Backcasting/Pre-mortem](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/backcasting-pre-mortem-premortem/)\n\n[News Headlines aka Cover Story](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/news-headlines-aka-cover-story/)\n\n[HMW](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/hmw/)\n\nRapid Prototyping\n\nPrototyping\n\nUser Testing\n\n[Design of Experiments](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-of-experiments/)\n\n## Further Information\n\n[The GV Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/) with link to the book\n\n[The Google Design Sprint](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/introduction/overview)\n\n[The GV Research Sprint](https://library.gv.com/the-gv-research-sprint-a-4-day-process-for-answering-important-startup-questions-97279b532b25) as introduced by Michael Margolis\n\n[The Enterprise Design Sprint](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/enterprise-design-sprints/) by Designbetter.com\n\n[The Design Sprint 2.0](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/design-sprint-2/) by Jonathan Courtney from AJ&Smart\n",

Both existing or future state business processes can be analysed. \n\nDomain Storytelling is driven by domain experts who share typical examples of how they work. These examples are known as Domain Stories. While listening, the moderator records the domain stories using a pictographic language, so domain experts can see immediately if the moderator understands their story correctly. The moderator guides the domain experts by asking questions, for example _who_ – _does what_ – _with what_ – _why_.\n\nA Domain Story covers _one concrete example_. It shows something that _actually_ happens, rather than all things that could _possibly_ happen. After several stories, the participants are able to talk about the people, activities, tools, work objects, and events in that domain.\n Often, the conversation that was started with Domain Storytelling is later continued with [user stories](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/user-story-mapping/), example mapping, [event storming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/event-storming/), etc.\n\n## Why use it?\n\n* learn about a new domain and pick up its language\n* elicit requirements\n* bridge gaps between departments\n* find boundaries for (micro)services or bounded contexts ([domain-driven design](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/domain-driven-design/))\n* show how new software systems will change current business processes\n\nDomain Storytelling is versatile and can facilitation adapted for the purpose, for example:\n\n* the level of detail (e.g. \"big picture\" or detailed workflows)\n* the number of participants\n* the tools (e.g pen & paper, sticky notes, digital modeling tools)\n\n## Further Information\n\nhttp://domainstorytelling.org\n\nhttps://leanpub.com/domainstorytelling\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nAn empathy map is a collaborative tool used to develop insight into customers, users, etc.. It is often a starting point for gaining empathy for the people a team is solving problems for. Like a persona, an empathy map can represent a group of people, such as a user or customer segment.\n\n* A way to form a better understanding of users and build personas\n* The information is captured as a brainstorm for a team to develop assumptions about the people \n* The information can also be directly added from interviews, observation and other facilitated conversation exercises\n* Senses captured can include what the person is seeing, thinking, doing and feeling with information captured on a big visible chart\n\n## When to use it?\n\nThis tool can be used at various times in the product lifecycle. If there is a need to gain new understanding about people that have an impact on the growth or use of an application, this may be a good time to consider an empathy map. Particularly when first learning about new customers, users, or stakeholders.\n\n* A tool to identify pain points, opportunities and starts to form a basis for improvement and optimization\n* Captures information and learning directly from the end user or customer effected by the system/application/solution in question\n* Enables a direct connection between important stakeholders and the product team (for example, developers of an application can learn directly from end users using it)\n\n## Facilitation Tips\n\nPrepare the team by letting them know this activity seeks to gain empathy for the 'human' solving a particular problem for. Let everyone know they are there to step into the shoes of the user, customer, etc.. \n\n* For an immersive activity, use large craft paper or a whiteboard to draw the map\n* Have everyone write on sticky notes to develop their assumptions around the map\n* Make sure to use different color sticky notes to represent different ideas from the team\n* If using to collect feedback from a interview session, the same can be done with sticky notes\n* Make sure to include a representation of the face in the middle of the map (this should differ based on the pain points)\n* Give your empathy map a name! Similar to a persona it is easier to make a human connection when a name is added\n\n## Origin\n\nThe Empathy map has been created as a practice by Dave Gray of [XPLANE](http://www.xplane.com/)\n\n## Resource Links\n\n* [Dave Gray's explanation of Empathy Mapping](https://gamestorming.com/empathy-mapping/) on Gamestorming.com\n* [What is an Empathy Map?](https://www.solutionsiq.com/resource/blog-post/what-is-an-empathy-map/) by SolutionsIQ\n* [The Practical Guide to Empathy Maps: 10-Minute User Personas](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/the-practical-guide-to-empathy-maps-creating-a-10-minute-persona/) from Studio by UX Pin\n* [Empathy Mapping: A Guide to Getting Inside a User’s Head](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/empathy-mapping-a-guide-to-getting-inside-a-users-head/) by UX Booth\n* [How to Run an Empathy & User Journey Mapping Workshop](https://medium.com/@harrybr/how-to-run-an-empathy-user-journey-mapping-workshop-813f3737067) by Harry Brignull\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nWhile it might be bizarre to say \"Principles over Practices\" in an article that is part of the \"Open Practice Library', that is exactly what this \"Practice\" is all about. Establishing a set of shared principles for yourself or your organization that is derived from your purpose and values and use those to guide you in the practices that you do every day.\n\nYou can think of Practices as the tip of the iceberg that is above the water, these are the ceremonies we do every day in our work. However, if we look under the water we will see that the larger part of the iceberg that keeps the tip of the iceberg above the water, these are our principles and values.\n\n![Iceberg with Practices above the water and Principles, Values and Why underwater](/images/purpose-values-principles-practices.svg \"Why Values Principles Practices Iceberg\")\n\n* Purpose (Why we are here) - our purpose, why this organization exists.\n* Values - a set of shared beliefs that guides the organization.\n* Principles (How we will act)- rules derived from our values and our purpose.\n* Practices (What we do)- actions you take in specific situations.\n\nOrganizations that have done the work to articulate \"why they exist and what they believe\" then need to clearly explain the \"how they will act\" they will work before they move to the \"what they will do\".\n\n## Why use it?\n\nTransforming organizations that start with a clearly articulated purpose and then establish a shared set of principles is more likely to succeed in their transformation than organizations that simply implement practices.\n\nPurpose, Values, and Principles are enduring but practices evolve and change over time. Blindly following practices are not encouraged, establish a set of shared principles and you can weather the storms that beat at your door.\n\nIt is important to use this lens to understand the success stories and reports we hear of successful organizations, often we only hear about their practices, the visible things they do, and less about their principles and values. Copying just the practices of successful organizations will not get us the same result if we do not also adopt the values and principles that originated these practices.\n\nFor example, when we talk about [visualization of work](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/visualisation-of-work/) we are really talking about providing transparency and improving understanding of work too. Providing transparency is not a practice. It is a principle that can be embodied by a whole lot of practices.\n\n## Further Information\n\nExamples of shared principles in organizations:\n\n* [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)\n* [Beta Codex 12 Laws](https://betacodex.org/)\n* [UK Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)\n* [Australian Government Digital Transformation Agency](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria)\n\nFurther Reading:\n\n* [Extreme Programming: Values, Principles, and Practices](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/extreme-programming-values-principles-and-practices/)\n* [Practices, Principles, Values](https://brodzinski.com/2014/08/practices-principles-values.html)\n* [Why We Fail to Change: Understanding Practices, Principles, and Values Is a Solution](https://www.infoq.com/articles/change-practices-principles-values/)\n",

      "body": "\n## What is Event Storming?\n\nEvent Storming is a rapid, interactive approach to business process discovery and design that yields high quality models. It was introduced in a blog by Alberto Brandolini[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) in 2013. At the end of the event storm, you should have:\n\n* A shared understanding of the business process you are building as part of the project, including:\n  * which steps should be considered in scope and which steps are out of scope\n  * the users involved in the process\n  * an initial inventory of UI screens for the process\n  * an initial inventory of Aggregates[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2)\n* A physical diagram with the above information, which can be transferred to a digital format\n\n## Why use Event Storming?\n\n* It is significantly faster, and a heck of a lot more fun, than traditional process modeling techniques. You'll be surprised how much you accomplish in a short period\n* It establishes a common and shared language between Business & IT\n* It sets focus in terms of scope and boundaries\n* The technique is iterative, which allows facilitators to:\n  * slowly adding more detail in each session as to not overwhelm participants.\n  * pick and choose participants by session\n  * provide cognitive breaks (participants will get tired)\n* It forces important questions about the customer journey early in the ideation process\n* It gives you the big picture of the solution by placing technical implementation details in context of the business process\n* It is particularly effective way to kick start Domain Driven Design[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3)\n\n## How to do Event Storming?\n\n* Business Team maps out the Business Process from a Users perspective\n* The Best way is to start with the 'happy scenario', where the User successful reaches their goal (eg Student buys movie tickets online)\n* In addition, the Business Team identifies which data is required in order to make the business flow successful (eg Movie Name, Session Time, Student discounted price)\n* Once the Business Process has been defined, the IT team will join to provide additional information in forms of Events, Data and User Interfaces. This will establish a shared understanding of what is required\n* The architect will start grouping common objects in order to define the microservices to be developed\n\n## Related Practices\n\n* [User Story Mapping](/practice/user-story-mapping/) is a great way to create an Agile delivery plan for a business process designed with Event Storming\n* Journey Mapping[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4) can provide a high level overview of the business process before using Event Storming to get into the details\n* Event Storming will identify key views for your user interface, which can jump start Site Mapping[<sup>5</sup>](#footnote-5) or Wireframing[<sup>6</sup>](#footnote-6)\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\n* Drawing paper roll[<sup>7</sup>](#footnote-7). Stickies tend to fall off walls otherwise.\n* 2 different colors of wide format sticky notes like the 4x6 sticky notes[<sup>8</sup>](#footnote-8)\n* 4 different colors of small square sticky notes like the 3x3 sticky notes[<sup>9</sup>](#footnote-9)\n* Permanent Markers for the stickies\n* Whiteboard markers if you use whiteboard roll, or charcoal pencils if you use drawing paper. Theses are useful to jot adhoc lines/arrows/annotations\n\n## External Resources\n\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>Alberto Brandolini's [original blog](http://ziobrando.blogspot.com/2013/11/introducing-event-storming.html)\n2. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>[Aggregates](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html) as defined by Martin Fowler\n3. <a name=\"footnote-3\"></a>Vaughn Vernon's [Domain Driven Design Distilled](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Distilled-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0134434420).

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nEverything as Code is the practice of treating all parts of the system as code. This means, storing configuration along with Source Code in a repository such as git or svn. Storing the configuration from bottom to top (communication switches, bare metal servers, operating systems, build configurations, application properties and deployment configurations...) as code means they are tracked and can be recreated at the click of a button.\n\nEverything as Code includes system design, also stored as code. In old world IT, infrastructure required specialised skills and physical hardware and cables to be installed. Systems were precious or were not touched / updated often as the people who created them no longer work for the company. The dawn of cloud computing and cloud native applications has meant it is cheap and easy to spin up virtual infrastructure. By storing the configuration of virtual environments as code, they can be life-cycled and recreated whenever needed.\n\n## Why store all things as code?\n\n1. Traceability - storing your config in `git` implies controls are in place to track who / why a config has changed. Changes can be applied and reverted and are tracked to a single user who made the change.\n2. Repeatable - moving from one cloud provider to another should be simple in modern application development. Picking a deployment target should be like shopping around for the best price that week. By storing all things as code, systems can be re-created in moments in various providers.\n3. Tested - Infra and code can be rolled out, validated and promoted into production environments with confidence and assurance it will behave as expected.\n4. Phoenix server - No more fear of a servers' configuration drifting. If a server needs to be patched or randomly dies, it's OK. Just create it again from the stored configuration.\n5. Shared understanding - When a cross-functional team is using 'Everything as Code' to describe all the parts of the Product they are developing together, they contribute to increase the shared understanding between Developers and Operations, they speak same language to describe the state of this Product and they use the same frameworks to accomplish their goals.\n\n## Further reading\n\n* [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/InfrastructureAsCode.html) on Infra as Code.\n* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an infrastructure automation tool created by Red Hat, the huge enterprise open source technology provider.\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nExample mapping is a technique for fleshing out and gaining clarity around the acceptance criteria for a given story. It is based on the idea that multiple examples of specific cases convey information better than a single bad abstraction of a concept.\n\n## When to use it?\n\nExample mapping should be used when you have the right people in the room to be able to explain business rules and example scenarios, and a technical team that can ask the right questions about those rules. It should be used as a tool to ensure that the team appropriately understands what is expected of the story, and to get the stakeholders involved in the development of acceptance criteria. It also brings to light misunderstandings while discussing specific examples of business rules.\n\n## How to do it?\n\nExample mapping uses four different colors of sticky notes, which are:\n\n1. Yellow - for the story itself (as a header for the example map)\n2. Blue - for specific rules associated with the story\n3. Green - for examples of rules\n4. Red - for questions that arise during the discussion\n\nBegin by selecting a story and write it on a yellow sticky note. Place it at the top of your example map as a header. In a horizontal row underneath that, begin writing business rules on blue sticky notes. Beneath the blue business rules, create columns of green sticky notes with individual examples of those business rules. These could be relatively unstructured, Friends-style \"The one where...\" examples, or full blown Gherkin criteria. \n\nAs misunderstandings arise surrounding individual examples or entire business rules, add red stickies with questions written on them if the right people to answer the question or resolve the misunderstanding are not in the room. \n\nWhen there are enough examples that everyone is comfortable with what is being asked in the story, they can be rewritten as both automated tests and acceptance criteria.\n\n![](/images/example-mapping-2-.png \"Example Map\")\n\n## Further Information\n\n<https://cucumber.io/blog/example-mapping-introduction/>\n\n<https://xebia.com/blog/example-mapping-steering-the-conversation/>\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwvrGfWmG_U>\n",

      "title": "Feature Toggles",
      "subtitle": "AKA Feature Flags/Bits/Flipping/Controls",
      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nFeature Flags (also known as Feature Bits/Toggles/Flipping/Controls) are an engineering practice that can be used to _change your software's functionality without changing and re-deploying your code_.\n\nIn software, a flag is \"one or more bits used to store binary values.\" So it's a Boolean that can either be true or false. A flag can be checked with an if statement. A feature in software is a bit of functionality that delivers some kind of value.\n\nIn it's simplest form a feature flag (or toggle) is just an if statement surrounding a bit of functionality in your software.\n\nHere is a simple example using pseudo-code (taken from the [Rollout Guide to Feature Flags](https://rollout.io/blog/ultimate-feature-flag-guide/)):\n\n```\nif(configFile[\"IsHoliday\"] == true) {\n  writeGreetingMessage(\"Happy holidays!\");\n}\n```\n\nOur code checks a configuration file, outside of the main program source code, to get the `isHoliday` variable and calls a function `writeGreetingMessage()` with the message `Happy holidays!` when the Boolean `isHoliday` is `true` in the configuration file.\n\nThe important thing about this example is that we are able to change the functionality of our software without changing and re-deploying our code, we can simply update our configuration file during _runtime_. Now every time we want to display the message `Happy holidays!` we can update our configuration file on the fly.\n\nEffectively feature flags allow us to separate deployment of our code from feature deployment. In order to do this we might use a configuration file, a UI at runtime or dynamically per-request based on the current context (a specific user or organisation etc).\n\n[In Martin Fowler's article on Feature Flags](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html) two major dimensions are identified to categorise feature flags: _how long the feature flag will live_ and _how dynamic the toggling decision must be_. The following four broad categories of feature flags are identified by Martin Fowler:\n\n- **Release Flags** allow incomplete and un-tested codepaths to be shipped to production as latent code which may never be turned on.\n- **Experiment Flags** are used to perform multivariate or A/B testing. Each user of the system is placed into a cohort and at runtime the user will be sent down one codepath or another.\n- **Ops Flags** are used to control operational aspects of our system's behaviour. We might introduce an Ops Flag when rolling out a new feature which has unclear performance implications so that system operators can disable or degrade that feature quickly in production if needed.\n- **Permissioning Flags** are used to change the features or product experience that certain users receive. For example we may have a set of \"premium\" features which we only toggle on for our paying customers. Or perhaps we have a set of \"alpha\" features which are only available to internal users and another set of \"beta\" features which are only available to internal users plus beta users.\n\n\nThese flag types can be summarised by the following image.\n\n![These flag types can be summarised by the following image.](/images/fowler_feature_toggles.png \"Feature Toggles categorised by longevity and dynamism\")\n\n## Why use it?\n\nFeature Toggles are a foundational engineering practice and provide a great way to manage the behaviour of the product in order to perform experiments or safeguard performance when releasing fresh new features. \n\nThere are many ways feature flags are used:\n\n- [Canary Releases](/practice/canary-release/).\n- [Dark Launches](/practice/dark-launches/).\n- [A/B Testing,  and running experiments](/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/).\n- [Multivari Testing](/practice/split-testing-multivari-testing/)\n- Turning things off with a kill switch.\n- Migrations or upgrades to a service.\n- Trunk Based Development and [Continuous Deployment](/practice/continuous-deployment/). Developers use feature flags to avoid long lived branches. Using a feature flag for functionality in development allows a developer to merge their code daily into the master branch.\n\n## Why & How to combine it with other practices?\n\nThe Feature Toggles can greatly complement and make easier the implementation of practices like [A/B Testing](/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/), [Canary Release](/practice/canary-release/), [Dark Launches](/practice/dark-launches/) in which the Feature Toggle is used to activate the “new” feature or version for a certain group/part of users. It is essential to the implementation of [Design of experiments](/practice/design-of-experiments/) practice.\n\n## Related Practices\n\n- [Blue/Green Deployment](/practice/blue-green-deployments/)\n- [Canary Release ](/practice/canary-release/)\n- [A/B Testing,  and running experiments](/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/)\n- [Multivari Testing](/practice/split-testing-multivari-testing/)\n- [Design of experiments](/practice/design-of-experiments/)\n- [Dark Launches](/practice/dark-launches/)\n- [Continuous Delivery](/practice/continuous-delivery/)\n- [Continuous Deployment](/practice/continuous-deployment/)\n\n\n## Further information\n\nThe following resources provide a rich source of further reading:\n\n- [Martin Fowler's article on Feature Toggles](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html) is one of the original articles on the topic.\n- [Wikipedia's article on Feature Toggles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle).\n- [Stack Overflow on What is a \"feature flag\"?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7707383/what-is-a-feature-flag).\n- [Further links to literature can be found on featureflags.io](https://featureflags.io/literature/).\n\nImage credit: Photo by [Karim MANJRA](https://unsplash.com/photos/pWlM5L6PFis) on Unsplash\n",

It frequently follows the flow inside an application towards achieving a specific goal. For example the purchasing of an item on an ecommerce site: the funnel analysis will show how many users go through the full flow of steps to complete a purchase and how many stop (drop off) at which step (aka fallout rates). \n\n![Funnel Analysis](/images/funnel-analysis.jpg \"Funnel Analysis\")\n\nThe Funnel Analysis is an effective way to analyse conversion and fallout in applications. It is often used as a way to measure performance of similar products, e.g. web shops.\n\n## Why use it?\n\n* This is a feedback loop practice, which allows the team to get prompt feedback from real life use of their changes\n* Funnel Analysis provides a way for benchmarking of similar products\n* It enables objective, data-informed decision-making in product teams\n* When carefully followed over time, the analysis can reveal the real impact of product/feature changes, both positive and negative\n* This is one of the practices that allow you to “tune the engine” and carry “innovation accounting” ( [The Lean Startup by Eric Ries](http://theleanstartup.com/))\n* The practice provides an objective criteria for important decisions on the product design, features, behaviour, etc. It is used as a way to enhance the product performance, the user experience and the business outcomes the product produces for your organization\n\n## Related Practices\n\nThis practice is fed with data from [A/B Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/), [Multi-vari Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-multivari-testing/), and can be one of the final steps for running experiments which started with the [Design of Experiments](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-of-experiments/). [Feature Toggles](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/feature-toggles/) can greatly benefit the analysis as they can be used to tweak the application based on live feed of data and show if certain changes would influence the outcome.\n\nThe analysis is the final step before decision-making.

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nHMW, short for “How Might We …?”, is an analytical technique relying on actionable questions asked from a particular point of view on a specific problem. They can be used to spur creative problem solving and produce insights, which lead to significant innovation. It can be used for Brainstorming, but is not necessarily a brainstorming approach. HMW is frequently used as part of Design Thinking sessions.\n\nYou need a challenge, a Point of View and a set of relevant questions starting with “How Might We …?”\n\n\\- The challenge/problem statement is critical for good results and may take time to formulate. It should not imply a solution or be too broad (boiling the ocean)\n\n\\- The point of view allow for use of empathy for the key actors.\n\n\\- Multiple HMW questions could be asked in order to dive deeper in the challenge and unveil different perspectives. The following are different perspectives, which can be used to look at the challenge through HMW questions:\n\n* Amplify the good\n* Remove the bad\n* Explore the opposite\n* Question an assumption\n* Go after adjectives \n* Identify unexpected resources\n* Create an analogy from need or context\n* Play against the challenge\n* Change a status quo\n* Break PoV into pieces\n\n![HMW](/images/hmw.jpg)\n\n## Why use it?\n\nHMW allows for creative problem-solving and going out of the established path of thinking. Especially when a lot of time has been spent on a particular direction and the team has developed “group think” or feels stuck.\n\nIt helps in breaking frames and molds and lead to innovative solutions. \n\nIt can easily “plug” and enhance many other practices, especially when you seek innovation.\n\n## Why & How to combine it with other practices?\n\n* HMW can be combined with [Impact Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-mapping/) as a way to search for deliverables that can influence a particular behaviour change of actor/s\n* During [Event Storming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/event-storming/) the team can often spot improvements or ideas for introducing a new way of handling the process, experiments to be carried out. A post-it with a draft HMW question can provide a nice bridge into a HMW and [Design of Experiments](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-of-experiments/) exercise.\n* A list of key questions are formed during facilitation of [Start at the End](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/start-at-the-end/).  HMW is a great approach to building key questions from assumptions that could lead to failure.\n\n## Related Practices\n\n* [Impact Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-mapping/)\n* [Design of Experiments](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-of-experiments/)\n* [Event Storming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/event-storming/) \n* Lean Canvas\n* Value Proposition Canvas\n\n## Origin\n\nMade popular by Procter & Gamble in the 1970s, but origin may be tracked as far back as Greek philosophers \n\n## Further information\n\nHBR: [The Secret  Phrase Top Innovators Use ](https://hbr.org/2012/09/the-secret-phrase-top-innovato)\n\nStanford d.School: [Intro and Guidance For Use](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/how-might-we-questions)  \n\nIDEO Design Kit: [HMW](http://www.designkit.org/methods/3)\n\nOpen Innovation Toolkit: [HMW](https://toolkit.mozilla.org/method/how-might-we/)\n\nGoogle Design Sprint Toolkit: [HMW](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase1-understand/how-might-we)\n",

It is a practice that allows people to get to know each other's dreams, it allows people to get to know each other in a deeper way beyond just \"My name is... My role is... \".\n\n## When should you use it?\n\nThis practice should be used when a team already knows each other, they already know each other's names, this is not the first time they are doing something together. \n\nUse this practice to allow people to get to know each other's dreams and allow them to get to know each other in a deeper manner beyond \"My name is... My role is...\".\n\n## Step by step\n\n**Explain - Write - Explain**\n\n1. **Explain** to the team that this practice was created so that people can get to know each other in a deeper way\n2. Ask every team member to **write 2 things on a post-it**\n   1. \"I Have a Dream that...\" with one of their biggest dreams in life\n   2. \"I have done this to achieve this dream...\" something they've already done in order to achieve the dream\n3. After everyone finishes, each team member **explains** their dream.\n\n## Some examples of what came out of this practice\n\n* _\"I have a dream that technologists look at ethics and morals as the basis for everything that is done\"_\n* _\"I have a dream that all children can participate in sports and arts\"_\n* _\"I have a dream that my children live in a world that will not be destroyed by climate change\"_\n* _\"I have a dream that my work/job becomes a permanent machine for improving the world and its people\"_\n\n## Where and why was this practice created? \n\nOn January 21, 2019, a team got together in Atlanta-Georgia in the US for a week working together, face to face, attempting to initiate the solution of a very complex problem. Everyone on this team had already met before, they knew each other's names and roles. Coincidentally this exact day was [Martin Luther King Jr. Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day) and they decided to create a different icebreaker/Team Building practice to achieve both goals: celebrate [MLK's I have a dream famous speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream). \n\n## External Links\n\n* [Other team building practices](http://www.funretrospectives.com/category/team-building/)\n* [Martin Luther King Jr. Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day)\n* [I have a dream speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream)\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nImpact Mapping is an engaging, graphical, strategic planning technique. It was introduced by Gojko Adzic in 2012. At the end of the impact map, you should have:\n\n* A shared understand of your effort's goal or problem statement\n* An inventory of human behavioral changes that must occur (or not occur) for your project to be successful. These are the impact from which the technique gets it name\n* Optionally, an inventory of project scope that could be delivered to achieve the aforementioned impacts\n* Some sort of prioritization of scope and/or impacts\n* A physical or digital diagram with the above information\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmSS69Dh71Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Why use Impact Mapping?\n\n* Most planning activities revolve around juggling a \"shopping list of features,\" as Gojko calls them. Even though the features are delivered, often the business objective is not achieved. Impact Mapping reorients us towards delivering value, not delivering features.\n* Impact Mapping introduces a very simple human centered design process, and as such, it is a great way to put lightweight design thinking techniques into practice\n* It's a graphical mind map, which reduces the barrier to entry for participants and facilitators alike\n* The technique is highly adaptable, because the core mind map is so simple. Gojko's original text describes a ~4 week executive level strategic planning workshop. It can also be run in a 4-6 hour session with Project Sponsors in the early stages of product development planning. These are just two of endless possible variations of the technique.\n* It is an excellent way to allow leadership and autonomous teams to have a conversation around strategic priorities and how they translate into the work of the team.\n* The focus on Impacts for key actors translates well into outcomes.\n* Impact Mapping is a way for leaders to practice leadership by intent (ref [David Marquet](https://www.davidmarquet.com/))\n\n## Related Practices\n\n* [Start At The End](/practice/start-at-the-end/) is another practice which leads to the same outputs. Compared to Start At The End, Impact Mapping produces a higher fidelity understanding of the domain, but at the cost of increased complexity for facilitation. Generally speaking, Impact Mapping is the better fit when building products or services, and Start At The End is a better fit when discussing organizational change or other generally nebulous efforts.\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n* Facilitator\n* Product Owner\n* Project Sponsor, both technical and business\n* Architects\n\n## Suggested Time\n\nFor the shortened variation:\n\n* 2-4 hours of prep to establish a goal or problem statement *before* the session. This is important, or your session will go sideways!\n* optionally - 2 hours before the session to create an outline of the Impact Map based on your current understanding, as a way to introduce the subject to participants\n* ~4 Hours to facilitate the session, not including breaks\n* Facilitate in small sessions @ around 60-90 minutes each\n* Session can be done on different days\n\nFor the executive level session format, see the Impact Mapping book[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1):\n\n## Difficulty\n\n* Facilitator: Moderate\n* Participants: Easy\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\nDigital Variation:\n\n* a mind mapping tool. we recommend coggle[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2)\n\nPhysical Variation:\n\n* a large whiteboard\n* whiteboard markers\n* sticky notes\n* markers for stickies\n\n## How does it fit?\n\n* Typically done in the Why area of the Discovery of the Open Practice Library\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8fxzeZh4Kc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## External Resources\n\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>Gojko Adzic's [original book](https://www.impactmapping.org/book.html)\n2. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>Impact Mapping tool: [coggle](https://coggle.it/)\n3. <a name=\"footnote-3\"></a>[Double Diamond design model](https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812)\n4.

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\n* An event where a development team collaborates with the Product Owner to align on the goal and outcome the team are going to focus on for their next iteration of development.\n* Team members use this opportunity to further their shared understanding of the Product Owner's (and stakeholders they represent) acceptance criteria (or conditions of satisfaction) for features they are going to accept into the iteration.\n* Team members decompose features into low level tasks with full breadth to deliver the features to a level whereby all of the Product Owner's conditions of satisfaction are met and the Definition of Done is satisfied.\n\n## Why use it?\n\n* Sets up the entire team for success throughout the iteration. Teams tend to focus on goals and activities more, when an end-date (deadline) has been set, by which the work needs to be completed. Keeping the overall iteration goal in mind, it keeps the team focused and ensures progress throughout the project.\n* Provides aligned and shared understanding of features to be worked on.\n* Provides a focus session of collaboration between all team members to determine all work tasks required to deliver the features into the next increment on the product.\n* A short burst of intense focus to build confidence across the team in their ability to achieve the next outcome and provide a space to collaborate to achieve this.\n\n## How to do it?\n\n* A typical iteration ranges between 1 and 4 weeks. At the beginning of an iteration, the team will hold a planning meeting to discuss and to break down features into tasks.\n* On average an iteration meeting will take around 1 hr for an iteration of 1 week. Subsequently, an iteration meeting would take on average 2 hours for an iteration of 2 weeks.\n* Coming into the meeting, the product owner will have a prioritised product backlog. Each feature will be discussed with the DevOps team, and the group collectively estimates the effort involved. The team will then make an iteration forecast, outlining how much work the team can complete from the product backlog. The features of work then become the iteration backlog.\n\nINPUTS: \n\n* Identified set of prioritised and defined User Stories from the Product Owner to the team\n* Capacity – Who is available, Are there any holiday, big meetings, etc during this period\r\n* Velocity – How much has the team been able to produce recently\n* Feedback ,Retro Actions and training – What else could provide value?\n\nAGENDA:\n\n* Independently review the Prioritised User Stories\n* Each person will have 5 minutes to ask last minute questions\n* Each person choose an story they will own (can work with other team members)\n* Each person will have 5 minutes to share the stories they will complete in the next sprint and how they relate to the priorities.\n* The group should call out gaps/concerns\n\nOUTPUTS: \n\n* Closed out previous Sprint. Load what seems to be an appropriate and agreed upon amount of stories for the next Sprint. \n\n## Related Links\n\n1. https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-planning\n",

      "subtitle": "The Kanban Picture suggests a \"work dynamic\" for teams starting with the Kanban Method. ",
      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nA suggestion to explain and start with the Kanban Method.  \n\n## Why use it?\n\nIt's simple and it's a funny explanation.\n\n## Explanation\n\n**Functional Item**\n\n“Between dogs and camels, all things are animals. You should avoid rats and Elephants” - Although there is variability in the size of the items, we avoid the extremes. A functional item generates value, each card on the board represents a delivery of value perceived by the business. if you want a dog, it’s leg, tail or head alone does not generate value.\n\n**Replenishment**\n\nReplenishment is the act of understanding and committing to demand. It is like a wedding - after the commitment point it is not desirable to give up the item (although it may happen :( ). Kanban is a pull system - Frequent replenishment is more agile, on-demand replenishment is most agile!\n\n**Kanban Meeting**\n\n“Stop starting, start finishing!” iterates across the tickets from right (closest to completion) to left (most recently started). “Ask the cards, not the people” - What can we do to finish this job?\n\n**Done/Demo**\n\nAt the end of the work, the team can demonstrate the result to the stakeholders. The team may decide to demonstrate on small batches of functionality of the same subject or on demand.\n\n**Retrospectives**\n\nEvaluate work output at regular intervals, analyze metrics and seek continuous improvement.\n\n**WIP Limit**\n\nLimit work in progress. These sample numbers represent the maximum number of functional items for workflow. Promote finishing and provoke important discussions. “Stop starting, start finishing!”\n\n**One Way**\n\nDo not move cards backwards. An item flows when work is completed at each step. If a correction needs to be made, keep the item in the same column, eventually signaling that a block exists. Focus on finishing.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n_Throughput_ - The amount of items delivered in a given time frame, usually weeks.\n\n_Lead Time_ - The clock starts ticking on replenishment and ends when the item is delivered.The number of calendar days to get an item done is the lead time.\n\n_CFD_ - Cumulative Flow Diagram Shows demand, WIP, approximate average lead time and delivery rate capabilities.\n\nTo collect these metrics you only need the start and finishing date for an item then count how many items you have per day in each column.\n\n**Explicit Policies** \n\nPost policies where you can see them. Policies are rules for how we work and should be developed collaboratively. Example - pull criteria, wip limits, date to deploy.\n\n**SDM**\n\nService Delivery Manager is a suggested role to manage the flow. SDM manages blockers, collects metrics, and supports team for flow improvement.\n\n**Class of Service**\n\nClass of service is based on cost of delay and defines how this category of item is\n treated in the system. A “tiger on fire” (expedite) has higher priority than other animals (standard). The most common classes of services are standard, expedite, fixed-date and intangible.\n\n**Extra**\n\n**_Blocker/Block Column_**\n\nDo not have a column for blocked items. A block is a condition for an item in some column of workflow, not a part of the workflow.\n",

      "subtitle": "Analysis & Matrix",
      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nThe Kano model is derived from the work of professor Noriaki Kano on product development and customer satisfaction. \n\nProf. Kano argues that customer preferences can be classified in five categories:\n\n\\- Must Have / Must-be (aka Musts, Basic Needs, Dissatisfiers) - covers product/feature expectations (requirements) which are taken for granted by the customers. When done well, customers are neutral, when not present or done poorly customers are very disappointed\n\n\\- One dimensional (aka Wants, Satisfiers, Wow factors) - covers product/feature expectations which are leading to satisfaction when present and dissatisfaction when not present\n\n\\- Attractive (aka Delighters)- covers product/feature expectations which provide satisfaction when realised, but do NOT cause dissatisfaction if not present\n\n\\- Indifferent (aka Neutrals) - covers product/feature expectations which are neither good nor bad in terms of impact on satisfaction. Often these are overlooked features or such that are of no importance to customer decisions and satisfaction regardless of their presence or lack of\n\n\\- Reverse - covers product/feature expectations which when realised well will cause dissatisfaction with some customers, who may appreciate better simplicity\n\n![Kano Matrix](/images/kano.jpg \"Kano Matrix\")\n\nThe Kano Matrix is used to easily plot the product features and have a discussions within the team about the correct category of a feature.\n\n\n\n## Why use it?\n\n* The Kano Model is widely used in Product Management for prioritisation of product features. It allows for easy visualisation and explanation of the impact and priority of different features. \n* It can involve the whole product team in the decision-making and help increase transparency of product decisions. \n* Developing new products goes hand in hand with generation of ideas, hypothesis and their testing/validation. Unfortunately, it is mostly impossible to test and evaluate all ideas and hypothesis we can come up with, which requires us to filter and prioritize work on them.\n* It is a simple, easy to understand and very visual and can include the whole team in the process of transparent selection of ideas/hypothesis to work on first.  \n* Helps the Product Managers (Product Owners) in prioritisation, building the product roadmap/backlog and explaining priorities to stakeholders.\n* It helps identify directions and ideas for pivoting.\n\n\n\n## Related Practices\n\n[How-Now-Wow Matrix](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/how-now-wow-prioritization-matrix/)\n\n[Impact & Effort Matrix](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-effort-prioritization-matrix/)\n\n[Whole Product Plotting](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/whole-product-plotting/)\n\nValue Slicing\n\n\n\n## Further information\n\n[The Kano model on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model)\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nA Lean Canvas is a one-page document that captures key information about your future product. The Lean Canvas is frequently used by Entrepreneurs and Lean Startups.\n\n## Why use it?\n\nThis document will help structure your idea in terms of: \n\n* What problem your product or service will solve\n* Who your potential customers are\n* How your product will be distributed and \n* How you will make money from it.\n\n## Variations\n\n### Lean Canvas\n\nThe [Lean Canvas](https://leanstack.com/leancanvas) was created by Ash Maurya and based on the [Business Model Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) by Alexander Osterwalder. It aims to shorten the product development lifecycle and rapidly discover if a product idea is viable.\n\n[Lean Canvas Template and Instructions](https://leanstack.com/LeanCanvas.pdf)\n\n### Lean UX Canvas\n\nJeff Gotheelf created the [Lean UX canvas](https://www.jeffgothelf.com/blog/leanuxcanvas/) to help organizations practice user-centered design and test hypotheses. Jeff based his work on the Lean Canvas and the Business Model Canvas.\n\n[Lean UX Canvas Template](https://www.jeffgothelf.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/LeanUX_canvas_v4.pdf)\n\n### UX Strategy Guide\n\nArielle McMahon created the UX Strategy Guide to help product teams vet ideas for new products and features. This guide is inspired by the Lean UX Canvas and Jim Kalbach’s [UX Strategy Blueprint](https://experiencinginformation.com/2014/08/12/ux-strategy-blueprint/).\n\nThe UX Strategy Guide provides a 12-step list of requirements, including metrics of success, risk assumptions, market research and more. Teams can follow the guide to validate product decisions with the right research and set their products up for success.\n\nArielle McMahon has kindly contributed this guide to the Open Practice Library.\n\n[UX Strategy Guide Template](/images/ux-strategy-template.jpg)\n\n### Business Model Canvas\n\nThe business model canvas is a variation that focuses on the development of new, improving existing or understanding the current business model. In a time where existing business models are disrupted this is a vital exercise. It adds the dimension of Key Partners, Key Activities, Customer Relationships, Customer Segments to the canvas.\n\n## How to use it\n\nWhen filling out the Lean Canvas, it is best to fill the sections out in a certain way. \n\n1. **Problem**\\\n   When filling out the problem section think with your future customer in mind. WHY is this a problem for them?\n2. **Target Customer**\\\n   Who are your early adopters of your product, specify them in terms of demographics, situation and interest.\n3. **Unique Value Proposition (UVP)** \\\n   Your UVP is directed to your customer, what makes your product or service so special to them? What is the benefit to them? \n4. **Solutions section**\\\n   It focuses on the key features of your product or service. Ideally, each aspect of the solution comes in line with one of the previously mentioned problems.\n5. **Channels**\\\n   How are you planning to promote your product? An example can be via 'word of mouth', colleagues, Instagram or Facebook.\n6. **Revenue Streams**\\\n   This section is about how you will make money of your product. For example: Freemium - 1st month free then you would charge $2.99 per month.\n7. **Cost Structure**\\\n   What are the costs you occur? An example here would be fees for Apple store or Google Pay.\n8. **Key Metrics**\\\n   How do you measure your success? For example: Number of paid subscribers like 300 downloads in the first month.\n9. **Unfair Advantage**\\\n   What makes your product unique. Something that cannot be easily copied or bought.\n\nWhen filling out the canvas, use bullet points. Don't write long sentences. A good canvas should be understood in a few minutes.\n\nMake sure you are filling out every box. There might be a lot of uncertainty but the canvas is there to help you and to structure your idea.\n",

Set up a Personal Kanban with three columns: To Discuss, Discussing, Discussed\n2. What to discuss\n   * Ask each person to write down topics they would like to talk about on separate sticky notes.  Time-box to a few minutes, ideally 3-5.\n   * Lay out the topics and group duplicates or similar discussion points\n3. Vote & talk\n   * Use Dot Voting to prioritize the topics\n   * Start the timer and move the highest priority topic to the \"Discussing\" column.  Have a volunteer start the conversation.\n   * At the end of a set time-box, ask the group if they want to keep talking about that topic or move on to the next by asking for a visual indicator, where:\n     * Thumbs up = \"keep talking about this topic\"\n     * Thumbs sideways = \"no strong opinion either way\"\n     * Thumbs down = \"end discussion and switch to next topic\"\n   * Keep updating the Kanban board.

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nIn a Lean UX Workshop, participants practice interviewing and learning about a user. Then, they prototype and refine a product that solves a real problem faced by that person. \n\n## Why use it?\n\nThis practice helps build a culture of user-centered design and lean UX. It's a hands-on activity that can provide a break from presentations or technical workshops. It's also a great icebreaker!\n\n## How to facilitate\n\nBefore each step, spend a minute or two explaining what participants will do and answering questions.\n\n* Introduce Lean UX and user-centered design. Depending on the audience, consider one or more of the following *(10-15 min)*:\n\n  * Demonstrate a mock user interview\n  * Show a short video\n  * Describe an experience practicing user-centered design.\n* Ask people to self-organize into groups of three and pick a role: User, Designer, or Developer.\n* Ask the designer to interview the user. *(3 min)*\n\n  * The designer asks user about his or her morning routine (from waking up to arriving at work).\n  * The interviewer looks for a problem that the user ran into and asks open-ended questions to learn more.\n* Ask the developer and designer to prototype a solution to the problem using Lego. *(7 min)*\n* Have the developer and designer present their solution to user and get feedback. If possible, they should let the user try out the product! *(3 min)*\n* Have the team refine the Lego solution and gather additional feedback. *(7 min)*\n* Ask two or three teams present their solutions. *(5 min)*\n\nThe facilitator should move from table to table to make sure teams are progressing. If teams finish early, they can build another prototype and A/B test the solution.\n\n### Tips\n\nConsider writing these notes on a whiteboard.\n\n* Ask open-ended questions - not closed (yes/no) questions.\n* Use the \"ladder\" technique: keep asking \"why\" to learn more.\n* When you have something to measure, use ratings on on a scale from 1 to 11. This helps participants give honest feedback instead of thinking of the rating like a grade in school.\n\n## Materials Needed\n\n* A timer or stopwatch (the [Time Timer](https://www.timetimer.com/) is great)\n* A whiteboard (optional)\n* Lots of Lego! The [Large Creative Brick box](https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/classic/products/lego-large-creative-brick-box-10698) is great.\n\n## Further Information\n\n* [Objectified: Smart Design OXO Good Grips Story](https://vimeo.com/106963722)\n\n  * This video is a great example of a team using user-centered design to solve real problems and develop a business valued at [worth hundreds of millions of dollars](https://web.archive.org/web/20161009174354/http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/2010/helen-of-troys-winning-acquisitions-hele-npk-lcut-nc-jah0706.aspx).\n* [Lean UX](https://www.jeffgothelf.com/lean-ux-book/)\n\n  * This book covers the overall \"How\" and \"Why\" behind this activity.

Then suddenly 3 of these tasks can continue and the person doesn't have the time to finish all of the same time. So the person gets overloaded, nobody knows how the progress is, and tasks get stuck in a progressed state where nobody else can help.\n\nIf one makes sure to only work on one task and then on the next one doesn't get overloaded. That means the person stays responsive, flexible and the status stays visible. If a task gets stuck waiting on external resources the person can help reducing this external dependency or making it more visible at least, to the rest of the team.\n\n## Further Information\n\n* [Kanban WIP Limits](https://kanbantool.com/kanban-wip-limits)\n* [Example projects (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFMlu87MkYI)\n* Image source: [\"Pipes, Valves and Gauges\"](http://www.flickr.com/photos/65534354@N00/4872229081) by Coggleswort00 is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n",

That means metrics also need to focus on work items, not on people. \n\nTypical activities for managing flow are:\n\n* visualize the work people do\n* limit the work in progress (so you can see where items get stuck and have enough free resources to handle that exception in a constructive way)\n* track how quick items go through the pipeline\n* think about how to modify your process so that stuck items won't get stuck again\n\n## Why use it?\n\nEverybody already experienced a few times in their life that it is totally possible that everybody is busy to the point of being overworked but the work gets done slower and slower.\n\nOne could ask themselves, why is that? And what is more important? Is it better that everybody is busy or would it be better if more work gets done?\n\nUsually in comparison it should be clear the second point is much more important: work needs to get done.\n\nBut to get there one cannot track indirect metrics like utilization of employees. Instead one needs to track work item related metrics like how long a task stays work in progress. And one needs to make visible when tasks get stuck so the team can analyse together why it got stuck and how this could be avoided the next time.\n\n## Further Information\n\n* [Article on agile42](https://www.agile42.com/en/blog/2015/04/09/managing-flow/)\n* [Example projects (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFMlu87MkYI)\n* picture source: [\"SnowDay2_04\"](https://www.flickr.com/photos/33549575@N04/4345634020) by cam_rich345 is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nMinimal Viable Product (MVP) refers the the minimum amount that can be produced and still obtain value. \r\n\n\rThis value does NOT have to come in the form of something released to the public. This can come in closed user testing, in which the value we gain is the feedback we receive. To that end many in the Agile community advocate for the term Earliest Testable Product (ETP), rather than MVP.\n\n## Why use it?\n\nSimple answer - **It unlocks value earlier**\n\n\rBuilding a product takes time, and using traditional method means the customer won't get any value until the end of the big bang release. Using MVP means the customer starts seeing the value from the product far faster\r\n\n\n\nIn addition as we gain feedback throughout this helps us insure that what we're building is also the right thing. Perhaps based on that feedback we may find that actually we only need a simple solution making it both cheaper and taking less time? Or perhaps we find that we can build something that the customer never imagined they needed but could help them immensely?\n\n\n\n## Further Information (including example)\n\n[Henriks Article on MVP](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp) - Still the best article I've found on the subject and some brilliant examples throughout\n",

It can also be a quick way to onboard new team members.\n\n## How to do it?\n\nMob programming involves the whole team working on a single piece of functionality at the same time. The easiest way to mob program is to have one team member driving a laptop that is connected to a large screen or projector.\n\nThe person behind the keyboard and mouse is usually called \"Driver\" and the others would be \"Navigators\". This role should be rotated if working on implementation. When using this practice for knowledge sharing then rotation is not necessary.\n\nThe whole team then implement the feature together by talking through the development together.\n\n## Further Information\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mob_programming>\n\n<https://medium.com/@springdo/the-last-unicorn-developer-pairing-and-mobbing-c2caaa29b54>\n\n<https://blog.marland.io/mob-programming/>\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nThis is a practice that looks to visually map out commonalities between members of the team or organization. It provides a map of how each person relates to one another. The goal of this practice is to create a spark for follow-on conversation between folks who may not have met before or deepen the relationship for those they have met.\n\n## Why use it?\n\nWhen new teams are forming, or there is a need for a team to form better relationships with one another, this practice can provide an easy way to begin that journey. The safe space it can provide only needs to go as deep as the two people creating the connection want to go, and does not discriminate those more extraverted or introverted. While the desire to form a relationship with the entire team, you may find yourself more connected to some and less connected to others. That is okay and understanding the level of comfort between two people is a step to understanding personal boundaries before they come up as an issue.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Everyone writes their name and a few personal characteristics (ie: Name, Where are you from, Favorite fictional character) on a post it\n2. Put that post it on a whiteboard or writeable canvas (use the full space)\n3. Find a partner and face each other. Each pair will line up to form two lines facing each other\n4. In 1-2 minutes, each pair needs to find something in common, draw a line on the whiteboard between their two post its and write out the common thing along that line. \n5. Have one line rotate to the left and repeat step 4 with your new partner\n\n\\*\\*Go through 3-4 rounds to create a good map, not necessary to everybody at first. \n\nCertainly can come back and do this again if the teams or organization is very large. This can also be a living document and put up somewhere in the room if you have a physical location, or referred back to if electronic.\n\n## Further Information\n\n* Initial base idea heard at Agile Games New England from [Erica Maguire's talk on \"Building Networks and Bridges\"](https://agilegamesnewengland2019.sched.com/event/MCkj/building-networks-and-bridges)\n",

It is forcing participants to start with the end in mind by imagining a distant future in which the product/service has been super successful and provoked the admiration of the public. \n\nThe participants start by listing a set of headlines and draft a popular magazine article outlining the success of the product/service and the organization. The magazine article would naturally go in details of the most important user benefits, i.e. why customers love it, beloved features, examples of use cases and may include images, customer quotes and other elements to make the story rich. \n\nThis practice frequently precedes other which require creativity. \n\nThe group is encouraged to picture and draw even their wildest ideas.\n\n## Why use it?\n\n* Helps translate vision into a set of characteristics to describe how it would feel and look when achieved\n* It allows to easily articulate the product/service goal\n* Allows the team to think big without the constraints of the present and the context they are in or where they are coming from\n* Serves as a stepping stone to Value Proposition or Lean Canvas by articulating some of the most important use cases, features and benefits.\n* It allows you to gradually move the focus from the features to the benefits (outcomes)\n* Provides really good input for the goal to be used in Impact Mapping\n\n## Why & How to combine it with other practices?\n\nThis practice is really helpful if you find it hard to articulate the goal during an Impact Mapping session. It can help articulate product vision and ambitions. \n\nIt is also a good transition from a vision into a more concrete description of expected product/service design, e.g. through [Event Storming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/event-storming/).\n\nIt can provide interesting input for Value Proposition and Lean Canvas.\n\n## Further Information\n\n[Cover Story](https://gamestorming.com/cover-story/) on Gamestorming.com\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nOpen leadership is a blend of mindsets, behaviors, and practices that enable people to thrive and contribute in an open organization.\n\nLeadership is not a position. The opportunity to lead is open to everyone. The role a person holds in the organization provides expression and amplification of their leadership behaviors, for good or for bad. \n\nOpen leaders default to open in their thinking and their actions. \n\nOpen leaders  believe:\n\nEveryone has something special to contribute\n\nEveryone has untapped potential\n\nEveryone has the responsibility to lead\n\nEveryone has a stake in the success of the company\n\n## Why use it?\n\nTo develop an Open Leadership Mindset. \n\n**Default to open mindset** - We believe open is a better way to do things, and therefore, it’s our “default setting.” Information should be transparent and open to all, unless there’s a good reason to close others’ access to it. You believe that everything from source code to policies to ideas to knowledge should be open to others to see, improve, build upon, remix, and modify to make it useful in new ways. \n\n**Inclusive mindset** - Everyone has something to contribute, and therefore, it’s best to include them in your efforts,. You don’t believe that you always know best, or that only “subject matter experts” should be included, though, they play a special role. You’re open to collaboration and co-creation.\n\n**Growth mindset** - as opposed to a fixed mindset. You believe that everyone has untapped potential, and that everyone is capable of improving through practice, training, and effort. \n\nYou believe that talent is not a fixed quality and that you're born with a certain amount.  While we all have different baseline levels of ability, anyone can improve at anything. Effort is far more important than talent, when it comes to achievement. This plays well with the inclusive mindset, because it opens you to the possibility that anyone can make a difference.\n\n**Opt-in mindset -**  while not everyone is a people manager, in an open organisation everyone can be a leader. You believe that everyone is capable of leading, and indeed, has a responsibility to do so. You believe it’s best to use your personal power (your influence), rather than your positional power, when interacting with others. And there are times when, even though you have the positional power, you expect your team members to lead the way and you will follow.\n\n**Enterprise mindset** - Putting the organization or company’s interests ahead of your own team’s interests or your self interest. It’s the belief that everyone benefits (at least on the whole), when we set aside our individual fiefdoms and interests, and work together toward common goals and with a shared purpose. It’s as relevant in open source communities as it is in companies.\n\n## Further Information\n\nYou can use Open Decision Framework (ODF) to practise open decision making. \n\nLearn more about open decision framework (ODF) at  Github :<https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework>\n\nwhat is open decision framework: <https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-decision-framework>\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nAn Opportunity Solution Tree is a visual aid that can help you find the best place to focus your team’s energies, whilst ensuring you consider enough opportunities. Opportunity solution trees bring transparency to the process and get the whole team to buy into the decisions being made and the solutions being tested. Here's an example:\n\n![](/images/opp-solution-tree.jpg)\n\n## Why use it?\n\nThis practice is a great way to ensure a product team is taking the time to prioritize user needs and generate enough solutions to needs to broaden the potential for finding the best idea. Often times, a team generates a solution and begins development right away without considering whether a solution is a good one. But \"good\" is a relative term, so ideally teams should be generating a myriad of product solutions in order to compare and contrast and allow the best option to emerge.\n\nAn Opportunity Solution Tree can be used at any point in the product lifecycle, from the beginning of a green field product to introducing it as means to drive iterative development of a mature product. When used to visualize the work being done in a product team's regular rhythm, it might look something like this:\n\n![](/images/ost-scale.png)\n\n## Overview of Steps\n\n1. Have the Product Manager pick a desired outcome.\n2. Generate opportunities (or problem statements) for achieving the desired outcome. Discuss as a team. (tip: if your team jumps straight to solutions, ask them what specific problem their solution solves, and capture that).\n3. Brainstorm solutions to specific opportunities (try [Crazy 8s Practice](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/crazy-8s/)). Discuss as a team.\n4. Have the team vote on the solutions with the most potential for success (try [Dot-Voting](http://www.funretrospectives.com/dot-voting/)).\n5. Create Experiments for the top 3 solution ideas.\n\n## Further Information\n\n1.

It can also be used at the end of the day as a team checkin for fast paced intensive work sessions, and can be used to facilitate the whole group populating an engagement journal entry.\n\n## How to use it?\n\nThis can be a whole group discussion, or done in pairs or threes, or even a solo reflection, writing exercise.\n\nAsk everyone to reflect on the work, and jot down the plus points, the minus points, and the interesting points.\n\nThe idea is to focus most on the interesting points, rather than dwell on the positives and negatives.  It's also an opportunity to compare perspectives.  One person may feel an event, or activity was interesting, whilst another found it positive etc.\n\n## Why use it?\n\nIt promotes \"And\" thinking.  Not just good, or bad, but points of interest too, it invites people to reflect in what happened without necessarily judging those events as good or bad. But it still lets people vent and celebrate as necessary.\n\n## Further Information\n\nEdward de Bono gets the credit for this one.\n\nhttps://www.virtuallibrary.info/pmi-plus-minus-interesting-strategy.html\n\nhttp://sourcesofinsight.com/avoid-the-intelligence-trap/\n\nhttps://www.google.com.au/search?q=de+bono+pmi\n",

If all alternatives score the same on that highest priority aspect, the next in line is used. This provides an objective discriminating factor and allows the team to take a decision on their own using the Priority Sliders as a decision principle.\n\n## Example priorities\n\nHere are some examples of priorities that could be considered.

      "body": "\n## What is proto-persona?\n\nProto-personas in Lean UX are like personas but without validation through months of lengthy expensive research studies. This is a ad-hoc persona created by need to begin work on a product immediately, not spending too much time in research. These personas are built with assumptions with knowledge of team and stakeholders. Over the course of the project, the proto-persona can be updated more accurately to reflect the target user with what we learn throughout the process. For e.g: survey, user interviews, usability testing and so on.\n\n## Why use proto-persona?\n\n* **Shared understanding:** This process helps everyone in the team to build a common vocabulary of the users they will design and develop. \n* **Help prioritise and drives focus:** Helps the team focus on the targeted users throughout. Avoid develop wrong product/ features not used by the users.\n* **Avoid risky knowledge gap:** There is a risk in knowledge gap between the team who creates persona and who uses them for e.g: external research team and the team working on the project. In Lean UX approach, the team creates the proto-persona together and validates them throughout with their learning.\n* **Iterative approach:** The persona is not a one-time activity whereas it goes through multiple iterative process through the research findings.\n* **Recruiting correct user type:** This also helps in prioritising the focus user groups for usability testing.\n\n## How to create and use proto-persona?\n\n* It is best to create the persona together in a team to build shared understanding so everyone feels contributed and buys-in on the final persona.\n* Discuss the group of users you have identified in user journey mapping, event storming, research, customer team and so on. List them down in posted note and discuss among the team and focus on the primary, secondary or focused user group whose problem you are trying to solve as a team.\n* Use the template or draw to list down their Attributes, Goal, Obstacles. Ofcourse, do not forget to give your persona a name.\n* Finally, put it on the wall and discuss in a team on your findings to built a consensus. Agree collectively as a team on the persona that suits your projects.\n\n## \n\n## Further Information\n\n* [Lean UX](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jeff-Gothelf/e/B00DUH5RD0?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&qid=1570107473&sr=8-1) by Jeff Gothelf\n* [Using Proto-Personas for Executive Alignment](https://uxmag.com/articles/using-proto-personas-for-executive-alignment) article by Jeff Gothelf\n* [A Guide for Creating Personas for Lean UX](https://www.ideatheorem.com/insights/guide-creating-proto-personas-lean-ux/), by IdeaTheorem Team\n* [UX: Creating Proto-Personas](https://uxdesign.cc/ux-creating-proto-personas-76a1738401a2), by Andrew jacobs\n* [Personas VS.

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nThe Realtime Retrospective technique was created by Emily Webber[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1). This is a great way to capture feedback from a large number of participants in realtime over an extended period of time. By the middle of your event you should already have:\n\n* some feedback in a timeline-like fashion that includes both positive and negative things\n* a capture of the mood and reaction of people over the course of time in a realtime manner\n* lots of sticky notes on a wall\n\n## How does it fit?\n\n* Typically done in the Culture and Collaboration area of the Foundation of the Open Practice Library.\n\n## Why use Realtime Retrospective?\n\n* Let's face it, nobody _likes_ filling out surveys, especially if it's more than three questions. Why not have the participants write unfiltered, uncensored, and quick feedback at the time they think of it? Realtime Retrospectives provide a low bar of entry and is voluntary and easy to participate anonymously.\n* For long running days or weeks with multiple sessions or activities, you can visibly see people's moods or grasp of the information in realtime.\n* When running similar sessions in quick succession, you may need to improve quickly and sometimes adjust on the fly.\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n* A _Facilitator_ (person to setup/cleanup).\n* Participants (anybody that was there during the timeframe).\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n* ~10 minutes setting up and cleaning up.\n* Wall is kept up over the course of 1-5 days for active participation.\n\n## Difficulty\n\n* Facilitator: Easy\n* Participants: Easy\n\n## Recipe\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\n* Drawing paper roll. Sticky notes tend to fall off walls otherwise.\n* 8×6 sticky notes[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-5).\n* At least 3 different colors of small 3×3 square sticky notes[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-6).\n* Several markers.\n* Some painter's tape.\n\n#### Preparations\n\n* Find a wall or surface that is long enough to handle the amount of feedback you are expecting.\n* Make a long line to represent time.\n* Draw a Happy Face above the line, a Sad Face below the line, and a Surprised Face along the line (this represents the type of feedback that you wish to receive – Positive, Negative, Surprised).\n  ![Realtime Retrospective Setup](/images/realtime-retro-prep.jpg \"Sample Prep Setup for Realtime Retrospective\")\n\n#### Step 1\n\nExplain to your participants your goal of using this practice and how to use your prepped area. Key things to share:\n\n* Where to find materials for them to contribute.\n* How the timelapse begins at the left and continues until the timeframe you designate as the end.\n* Any and all feedback is welcome, 1 post-it per feedback item.\n\n#### Step 2\n\nCycle back constantly to review your feedback and make appropriate improvements based on them.\n\n## Related Practices\n\n* Timeline Retrospectives by Patrick Kua[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-2) uses a similar approach to gathering feedback in a sequential order\n* Linda Rising has a concept of the Continuous Retrospective[<sup>5</sup>](#footnote-3) that uses the timeline aspect of the Timeline Retrospective and to reflect on it everyday as a team.\n\n## External References\n\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>[Realtime Retrospectives](http://emilywebber.co.uk/the-realtime-retrospective/) by Emily Webber.\n2. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>8×6 sticky notes [example](https://www.amazon.com/Post-Sticky-Janeiro-Collection-6845-SSP/dp/B000CD0MHQ/).\n3. <a name=\"footnote-3\"></a>3×3 sticky notes [example](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1UE0JY?psc=1).\n4. <a name=\"footnote-4\"></a>[Timeline Retrospectives](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1UE0JY?psc=1) by Patrick Kua.\n5. <a name=\"footnote-5\"></a>[Continuous Retrospective](https://www.infoq.com/articles/rising-continuous-retrospective/) by Linda Rising.\n\nAnother interesting reference: [the Double Diamond design model](https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812).\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\n* A mechanism for sizing different items relative to each other.\n* A tool to facilitate conversations, especially where there are different views on relative sizes.\n* Common techniques include use of story points, planning poker, t-shirt sizes and double figures.\n\n## Why use it?\n\n* Facilitates conversation.\n* Helps align groups of people to reach consensus on their understanding regarding the size of complexity and/or value of an item.\n* Avoids the emotion, buffering and other negative side effects of absolute estimation.\n\n## Relative Estimation Example\n\nLet's say for example you were asked to estimate how difficult it is to eat the fruit below?\n\n![](/images/apple.jpg)\n\n1. If we were using story points the first challenge here would be identifying the 1-pointer. Let's say that is the grape. \n2. From there we then compare the other fruits to the grape. \n3. Maybe the apple is a bit tougher as you've got to eat around the core, so let's call that a 2-pointer.\n4. Then the orange and banana have to be peeled first so that might make it more difficult than both of the previous fruits. We therefore know it's harder than the grape and apple but how much harder? Is it harder than the coconut?\n5. Probably not. So lets call them a 3-pointer and the coconut, which requires a lot more effort, an 8-pointer.\n\nAs we go through these estimations conversations will occur within the team and you'll discover more with understandings beginning to align. In this example this might include things like: \n\n* Perhaps someone has a tool that makes opening coconuts easier so maybe it doesn't require as much effort as we thought?\n* Maybe the orange has pips in it and also it's more difficult than the banana?\n\n## A helpful tool for big planning\n\nThe Relative estimation line is one technique that can help with this sort of thing allowing for quick and easy estimation based on past experience. This line should contain reference stories that have already been estimated (or preferably completed) and allows the team to compare previous work.\n\nAn example:\n\n* 'Okay we have story A, is this bigger than the 3 points we have here?' \n* Assuming yes - 'Okay is it bigger than the 8 pointer? Or is it roughly the same size'\n* Assuming no - 'Okay so we'll say its a 5 pointer then' \n\n![](/images/sizing.jpg)\n\n## Further Information\n\n* [Mike Cohn Blog Post about Story Points](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/what-are-story-points)\n* [Mike Cohn Blog Post about Tee-shirt Sizing](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/estimating-with-tee-shirt-sizes)\n",

      "subtitle": "Reflect, inspect and adapt ways of working to drive continuous team improvement",
      "body": "\n## What are they?\n\nRetrospectives provide opportunities for groups to reflect, inspect and adapt their ways of working. They often take place at the end of sprints but can be scheduled at any time. There are a myriad of types of retrospectives you can run with your team, and it's good to mix things up to keep things from getting stale which leads to decline in involvement. You might run something like in the header image (The Heroes Journey), then maybe try this sailboat retro the next time:\n\n![](/images/pirate-retro.png)\n\n## Why use Retrospectives?\n\nRetrospectives facilitate continuous improvement. Rather than wait until the end of a project to run a full \"lessons learned\" exercise for the entire delivery, we encourage taking short time boxes during delivery for the team to course correct and find ways to improve their way of working. This should come in the form of  actions agreed by the team with owners and estimated time due dates, allowing for tracking and helping to ensure their completion. \n\n## Who do you need?\n\n* Facilitator\n* The Team\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n* Varies based on the duration of the time period the retrospective is covering. We recommend allowing 30-60 minutes for a one week sprint retrospective.\n\n## Difficulty\n\n* Facilitator: Easy\n* Participants: Easy\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\nThere are lots of different formats retrospectives can take (see the references for links to some excellent resources which provide ideas). Typical materials used during facilitation include:\n\n* Flat space which will hold sticky notes\n* Stickies (preferably a wide variety)\n* Sharpie pens\n* White-board pens if using a white board or MagicWhiteboard paper\n* Clock for time boxing\n\n## Advice\n\n* Be careful not to dwell too heavily on things outside of the teams control. Ensure you track them and raise them to the relevant owners but value can rarely be found in a one hour ranting session.\n* Retro's are within reason whatever a team needs to be. They can be broad and encompass multiple issues and problems, or with the teams permission can drill down into specific issues using techniques such as the 5 whys.\n* Locations can play a major role in the outcome of a Retrospective. Changing a Retro location to a Cafe, pub or even using techniques such as the walking retro can help to drive out different problems/issues that might not have come up otherwise\n\n## Related Practices\n\nMany practices benefit from their artefacts being re-visited, reflected upon and/or updated during retrospectives including:\n\n* [Social Contract](/practice/social-contract/)\n* [Team Sentiment](/practice/team-sentiment/)\n* [Burndown Charts](/practice/burndown/)\n* [Visualisation of Work](/practice/visualisation-of-work/)\n\nEngineering practices such as Continuous Integration and Test Automation can also benefit from being considered during retrospectives. In particular, exporting data from associated tools to give teams the opportunity for the team to review the data, inspect trends and establish whether any adaption in behavior or practice would enable them and measurements to improve.\n\nThe [Realtime-Retrospective](/practice/realtime-retrospective/) is a very similar practice which runs continuously and captured feedback in real time.\n\n## External References\n\n1.

      "body": "\n## So what is a Service Blueprint?\n\nBefore jumping into activity details please consider a brief overview about the origins of [Service Design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/service-design-design-is-not-just-for-products/?target=_blank).\n\n> “In 1982, the term “service design” was coined by Lynn Shostack. It was proposed that a business should develop a “service blueprint” which details the processes within a company and how each process interacts with other processes.”\n\nLynn Shostack later wrote an article for the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/1984/01/designing-services-that-deliver/?target=_blank) which evangelized service design methodology and the service blueprint.  \n\nFor the purposes of digital product and software practices, the Service Blueprint is an applied process chart which holistically dissects a particular operational workflow, product offering, business structure, or the like. The blueprint is always mapped from a people perspective providing empathy and shared understanding of the user, business, technical, and support actions for process steps, all in one easy to digest chart.\n\nThe typical service blueprint for a technical project will identify:\n\n**1: Physical Evidence:** Tangible items associated with each step of the process\\\n**2: People Actions:** User steps that people take as part of the process\\\n_Line of Interaction: Separates people actions from technical actions_\\\n**3: Front-stage Actions:** The technical interface or tools people interact with in each step\\\n_Line of Visibility: Separates front-stage and back-stage actions_\\\n**4: Back-stage Actions:** Non-visible technical requirements needed for each step\\\n_Line of Internal Interaction: Separates technical actions from external support efforts_\\\n**5: Support Channels:** Activities or tools required for the process to be delivered\n\nThe example below is a simple overview for the end result of a Service Blueprint. The chart typically begins as a whiteboard sketch and will iterate toward a more refined design. If it suites the project team a digital template could also be completed for this activity. \n\n![service blueprint template](/images/service_design_blueprint.png)\n\nNOTE: Multiple users are usually added to the People actions because more than one user is often needed to complete a process step. A couple users make for a simple blueprint in a quick amount of activity time, while an increased number of users make for a more complex blueprint which will take longer to create.\n\n## Why do a Service Blueprint?\n\nThis versatile activity can help identify process problem areas and growth opportunities for business operational workflows, a new or existing product offering, as well as the business structure of a startup or established company. The chart is meant to be flexible with the type of process reviewed and project needs.\n\nThe blueprint will quickly point out assumptions and unknowns about a process across all business units, plus discover any confusion or misinterpretations within the process steps. This information can drive exploratory and validation research with users along with necessary technical and business research, to later define opportunities, strategy and solutions.\n\n## How to do a Service Blueprint?\n\nIt is important to have primary users identified prior to starting the blueprint but some exploration of secondary or tertiary persona groups will be done with the activity. Focus on one (1) main process per service blueprint, prioritized by the top user/business problems to be solved. Follow these steps to initiate and develop blueprint:\n\n**Step #1:** Book a work area with a large whiteboard or flat wall surface to create the blueprint. It is ideal if the chart can remain in this area for the length of the project because it is often referenced with later activities.\n\n**Step #2:** Before the activity starts create a large physical template for the Service Blueprint chart. If a whiteboard is used make a grid with painters tape to mark off areas for Physical Evidence, People, a Line of Interaction, Front-stage, a Line of Visibility, Back-stage, a Line of Internal Interaction, and Support Channels. Be sure to leave extra space in the height of the action sections (especially People) for adding multiple rows. If a flat wall surface is available butcher paper and sticky notes will also work well.\n\n**Step #3:** Gather project team to the area and walk through an overview of the Service Blueprint template and why it will be helpful in reaching goals. Talk through the how-to instructions and ensure the team is aligned on guidelines. Also, see Tip #2 below for an easy way to introduce the blueprint concept. \n\n**Step #4:** As a team review and align on the business process that will be dissected for this service blueprint activity. Discuss the People who are involved with this process so there is consensus on the actions being considered. The chart is flexible and can unfold a simple or complex process depending on needs of the project. \n\n**Step #5:** Facilitate the first step in the process by identifying each section of the blueprint as a vertical slice, ensure the team focuses on just one step at a time. With Front-stage consider tools such as email, interfaces or internal/external tools needed, etc., to complete the step.\n\n* Often new users or front/back-stage requirements come up further along in the process chart so leave room for adding new rows.\n* For Physical Evidence consider hardware and devices, or anything tangible and draw a small picture of these items in the row.\n* For People make sure to first focus upon primary users of the action, then add each user in a new row, to complete the step. The action steps can be drawn like a user flow diagram. \n* With Back-stage consider what makes the Front-stage feasible. Consider which databases or servers are required, etc. These sections are usually drawn like an information architecture diagram. \n* With Support Channels think of help systems, chat, or third-parties that help deliver that step. \n\n**Step #6:** Take turns facilitating steps of the process chart and try to give everyone on the team a chance to work through at least one step. Or if the group is less inclined to collaborate feel free to use one facilitator for the entire blueprint.\n\nSome facilitator tips that are good to consider include:\n\n**Tip #1:** Use different widths or colors of painters tape to separate the sections for Actions from Lines. Sometimes the blueprint length extends longer than anticipated (depending on number of process steps) so keep tape or butcher paper handy if that happens.\n\n**Tip #2:** Introducing the Service Blueprint can be a complex concept to adapt. Using a simple metaphor is a good way to overview the activity for a project team. As with some other user related tasks, the analogy of Live Theater works quite well. The story is usually shared via improv but goes something like this: \n\n> On stage facing the audience (is the Front-stage) then there are actors (the People) who use props (their Physical Evidence) to act out scenes (the Steps) in a play (our Process). Behind the curtains (which is the Line of Visibility) many tasks produce the play (which is the Back-stage). Also there are partners who keep the theater operating (the Support Channels). \n\nThis is nicely explained while doing a quick whiteboard sketch to talk through the analogy and referencing the blueprint template.\n\n![blueprint concept sketch](/images/blueprint_concept_sketch.jpg)\n\n**Tip #3:** When the service blueprint activity begins, make sure to talk through each vertical step of the process chart out loud prior to documenting. This will ensure alignment and shared decision making. \n\n**Tip #4:** Be visual and use drawings whenever possible to represent the information shared, this will create an easy to reference chart (e.g. draw a cell phone when referring to this as physical evidence or draw a database symbol to reference this in back-stage actions). Also, use multiple colored pens to highlight certain areas of interest with each step, either with notes, boxes, dashed lines, etc.. For example, Red can quickly identify unknowns or problems and maybe Blue can identify opportunities, etc.. Draw a ‘key’ in one corner of the blueprint for viewers to understand symbols and color coding.\n\n**Tip #5:** If the blueprint sketch can not stay in the scheduled work area, digitize it and print it as a large poster this will go a long way as point of reference and makes a nice centerpiece for project presentations. Also, be sure to capture pictures through the activity, including panoramic shots! A time-lapse might be nice too. \n\n**Tip #6:** Reference the blueprint after conducting research and update it based upon findings. It will be easier to do so if the blueprint is digitized after the initial activity. \n\n## Outcomes\n\nA user-centered chart with holistic views across all business units required to deliver the process being reviewed. This includes a detailed contextual understanding of process unknowns, problems and opportunities, plus empathy for the people responsible for each step. This information can be used for research efforts and strategy development. \n\nService blueprinting is a fun, collaborative activity that can truly drive direction for many projects,  plus the chart deliverable resonates well with stakeholders. \n\n## ‘Process’ Examples\n\n* Enterprise B2B Application: Employee Workflow Process\n* Software as a Service: User Journey Process\n* Service Organization: Customer Experience Process\n* Startup Company: Entire Business Process\n\n## Facilitation Notes\n\n**Prerequisite Knowledge**\\\nIt is best if an understanding of the people ecosystem and primary users is known ahead of this activity. A priority of top user and business problems to solve should also be established. Spend time before starting the blueprint to determine one (1) main process to focus upon which aligns with the primary users and prioritized problems.\n\n**Deliverable**\\\nThe level of  final chart fidelity should be determined by project requirements and goals, this blueprint can be reviewed as a photograph, digitized and shared virtually, or printed as a poster and displayed. \n\n**Experimentation**\\\nIt is encouraged to experiment with the type of process reviewed. This activity works well for all industries and business categories.\n\n**Supply list for whiteboard:**\n\n* Painters Tape (1” for Action rows, ¼” for Lines rows)\n* Dry Erase pens (multiple colors)\n* Camera(s) for documenting\n* Sticky notes & Sharpies for good measure\n\n**Supply list for wall space:**\n\n* Butcher Paper (white is best - might need two rows of paper)\n* Markers (multiple colors) \n* or Sticky notes (multiple colors) & Sharpies\n* Camera(s) for documenting\n\n## Resource Links\n\n* [Service Blueprints: Laying the Foundation](https://www.cooper.com/journal/2014/08/service-blueprints-laying-the-foundation)\n* [Service Blueprint Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_blueprint)\n* [Service Design Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_design)\n* [RealtimeBoard Blueprint Free Template](https://realtimeboard.com/examples/service-blueprint)\n* [Practical Service Design Free Resources](http://www.practicalservicedesign.com/resources)\n* [Mural.co Blueprint Free Template](https://mural.co/templates/service-blueprint)\n\n## Related Practices\n\n* [Event Storming](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/event-storming)\n* [Impact Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-mapping)\n",

Showcases should be as interactive as possible, aiding the team in collecting real world feedback\n* Showcases should be a comfortable and open environment for people to speak freely. Encourage negative as well as positive feedback, this is the only way to ensure that you're building the right thing \n\n## Related Links\n\n1. https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-review\n2. https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/sprint-review-meeting\n3. https://www.scaledagileframework.com/system-demo/\n",

      "title": "Social Contract",
      "subtitle": "Build a constructive, fun team culture",
      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nThe Social Contract is a simple, yet highly effective manner to enable team autonomy and self accountability for engagements. The Social Contract is created by and for the team.  It looks to codify the behaviors and expectations of the team. It also provides a mechanism for the team to radiate and share its desired behaviours with management and other stakeholders.\n\nTo effectively use this practice you should look to create the following outcomes:\n\n* Public display of the social contract\n* Nobody is above the contract\n* The team agreed holds each other accountable to the contract. Having every team member physically sign the contract can provide a good starting point for this.\n* Revisit the social contract often and update it as necessary\n\n## Example Questions\n\nTry to guide the team to a contract that encourages positivity, autonomy, and respect.\n\n* What sort of team culture do you want to build?\n  * Open, positive, blame-free, constructive\n  * Fun!\n  * No magic, no wizardry, no ninjas - build shared understanding\n  * Celebrate success\n* What core hours do you want to work?\n  * 10am - 3pm?\n  * The idea is _not_ to encourage a clock-in/clock-out mindset. It's about giving people the freedom to work the hours that make sense for them while ensuring that the team can still meet together.\n* What are your thoughts on pair programming? Mob programming?\n  * Mob to learn; pair to build?\n  * Focus, then share what you learned?\n  * Respect individual working styles\n* How should we handle devices in meetings?\n  * Laptops closed and phones down?\n* Step out if you need to work on something else?\n  * How do you want to track tasks?\n  * Jira?\n  * Paper stickies?\n  * This helps us avoid missing important stuff or duplicating work.\n* Embrace creative chaos\n\n## Don't do this\n\nAvoid building a social contract that encourages antagonistic, command-and-control behavior. Here's an example of a really bad social contract:\n\n* Core hours are 9am-7pm. The more time you spend at a desk, the more you'll accomplish.\n* Be more productive by juggling several projects at once.\n* Ensure accountability by finding someone to blame when things break.\n* Deploying to production is scary because it's an opportunity to get blamed for something (see above). Code should be deployed as infrequently as possible.\n* When you learn something, be sure to keep it to yourself so that everyone can see what a ninja rockstar wizard unicorn you are.\n\n## Why use a Social Contract?\n\n* Quick means to clearly determine team dynamics and expectations\n* Promote autonomy and self governing of team behavior\n* The contract keeps the team consciously aware of how they work together\n* Establish empathy and context for future conversations between team members\n\n## Materials Needed\n\n* Wall space which will hold sticky notes.\n* Whiteboard markers\n* Stickies (preferably a wide variety)\n* Large poster paper\n\n## How To\n\nStick the large poster paper on the wall and label it \"Social Contract.\"\n\nExplain to the team that we're going to:\n\n* Define the kind of culture we want our team to have\n* Set some general guidelines\n* Hold one another accountable to these guidelines\n\nAsk open-ended questions about the team's desired way of working. If the team agrees to an answer, write the decision on a sticky note and put the note on the poster paper. If there's not consensus, throw the sticky note away or put it in the parking lot for later discussion.\n\nAt the end, ask the team to sign the contract, and keep it in a visible place. Note that this is a living document so the team can revisit it later, change it, and initial it to indicate that everyone has agreed to the change.\n\nAs the team moves forward, encourage them to refer back to the contract when there are disagreements.\n\n## Related Practices\n\n* Collaborative Face Drawing[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) is a great ice breaker or after lunch activity. Your Social Contract can be a nicely decorated with the faces of the team to show their commitment to the contract.\n* Working Agreements[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2) are a form of social contract often used to help establish behavioral standards between peers on a team. This is a great alternative if you do not have stakeholders or sponsors buying in to a Social Contract.\n* Use [retrospectives](/practice/retrospectives/) as a tool to revisit and update Social Contract based on learnings of team members working with each other\n\n## External References\n\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>[Collaborative Face Drawing](http://www.funretrospectives.com/collaborative-face-drawing/)\n2. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>[Working Agreements for a Scrum Team](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2014/january/work-agreements-for-a-scrum-team)\n3. <a name=\"footnote-3\"></a>[Social Contract](https://theagileexecutive.com/tag/social-contract/)\n4.

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nThis is a randomised experiment in which we compare and evaluate the performance of different versions of a product in pairs. Both product versions are available in production (live) and randomly provided to different users. Data is being collected about the traffic, interaction, time spent and other relevant metrics, which will be used to judge the effectiveness of the two different versions based on the change in user’s behaviour. The test determines which version is performing better in terms of the target outcomes you have started with.\n\nYou can compare two or more different versions of an application/product as long as you always do that in pairs. The pairs need to be identical except for a single characteristic which will vary between the two versions. \n\nThe team should take care with regards to:\n\n* Differentiating the users, e.g. new users from returning users (cohorts). \n* Comparing results - the results may not always point a significant difference between the versions and may either need to be run longer or different combinations of pairs should be used\n* Running the test always simultaneously as multiple factors may vary with time and influence the results\n\n## Why use it?\n\nSimple to apply, fast to execute and often conclusions can be made simply by comparing the conversion/activity data between the two versions. It can be limiting as the two versions should not differ too much and more significant changes in the product may require a large number of A/B tests to be performed. \n\nThis is one of the practices that allow you to “tune the engine” as per [The Lean Startup by Eric Ries.](http://theleanstartup.com/)\n\nThe practice provides an objective criteria for important decisions on the product design, features, behaviour, etc. It is used as a way to enhance the product performance, the user experience and the results the product produce for your organization.\n\n## Related Practices\n\n[Split Testing - Multivari Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-multivari-testing/)\n\n[Design of Experiments](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-of-experiments/)\n\n## Further information\n\n[The Ultimate Guide to A/B Testing, Paras Chopra, Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/the-ultimate-guide-to-a-b-testing/)\n\n[The ABC of A/B Testing, Cara Olson, Marketing Land](https://marketingland.com/the-abcs-of-ab-testing-42554)\n\n[Blue-green Deployments, A/B Testing, and Canary Releases](http://blog.christianposta.com/deploy/blue-green-deployments-a-b-testing-and-canary-releases/)\n",

      "subtitle": "Quantitatively test how multiple factors influence the success of a design",
      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nMultivari, aka Multivariate or Multi-variable testing, is a product testing approach, which allow teams to understand influence of multiple different factors on the product performance. \n\nIf you have many factors (potentially) influencing the performance of a product, an [A/B testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/) approach will take enormous amount of tests and time, because you can only test the difference of the product performance with two different values of a particular factor (A and B) at a time. An A/B test will also not tell you of potential reinforcement between factors. \n\nThis is where Multivari testing comes in. Unlike [A/B testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/), Multivari testing will allow you to design product versions which differ from each other on multiple different factors. As in A/B testing all of the different product versions will be available in production and customers will be randomly redirected to different versions. The results from the customer interactions with the different versions will be collected as raw data.\n\nYou can then understand the impact of each factor as well as the interplay of those factors using a statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA or MANOVA) over the collected data. \n\nIt is important to note that multivari testing requires more transactions/interactions with the product in order to achieve a statistically significant amount of data. If the data is insufficient the results will not be representative of the whole population, i.e. not meaningful. \n\nSeveral variations of Multivari Testing to consider:\n\n* **Full factorial testing** - testing of all possible combinations of the factors\n* **Fractional factorial testing** - only partial combination of the factors is tested \n* **Taguchi testing** - a partial combination defined with use of heuristics or other methods\n\n## Why use it?\n\nThis practice can save significant efforts and time when assessing the impacts of different factors on the performance of a product/service. When multiple factors are at play, an A/B test becomes hard to impossible to execute and as pointed an A/B test will not really provide answers on the interplay fo factors. \n\nThe results of the testing will ultimately provide answers to the question which combination of factors (e.g. features) achieves the best performance. \n\nThis is why this practice is one of the important practices in the pivot phase of product development.  \n\n## Related Practices\n\n[Split Testing - A/B Testing](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/split-testing-a-b-testing/)\n\n[Design of Experiments](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-of-experiments/)\n\n## Further information\n\n[Multivariate Testing 101: A Scientific Method Of Optimizing Design, Paras Chopra, Smashing Magazine ](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/04/multivariate-testing-101-a-scientific-method-of-optimizing-design/)\n\n[Multivariate Testing In Action: Five Simple Steps To Increase Conversion Rates, Paras Chopra, Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/11/multivariate-testing-in-action-five-simple-steps-to-increase-conversion-rates/)\n\nImage credit: Photo by [Steve Harvey](https://unsplash.com/photos/kV7S3tyvKa8) on Unsplash\n",

It's a rather simple exercise, which asks participants to describe what success looks like for their work, and use this to define the goal of the effort. We default to 12 months, but it can be longer or shorter. Then, the exercise asks participants to imagine all the ways their project can fail, and using the results to enumerate key questions or assumptions that must be examined at the start of the work. The technique is derived from Chapter 4 of The Sprint Book[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1). At the end of the exercise, you will have:\n\n* A shared understanding of your effort's goal\n* A list of key questions or assumptions that need to be examined early in the work effort in order for the team to achieve the goal.\n* A prioritization of the key questions\n\n## Why use Start At The End?\n\n* Most planning activities revolve around juggling a \"shopping list of features,\" as Gojko Adzic calls them in [Impact Mapping](/practice/impact-mapping/). Even though the features are delivered, often the business objective is not achieved. Start At The End gives us a light weight approach to put the business value at the center of our work and make sure that assumptions that could lead to failure are clearly identified for examination.\n* Start At The End is really easy and quick to facilitate, but often yields great results. It's a great technique for those new to facilitating workshops or sessions that are short on time.\n* This activity helps you and your team envision what the future will look like when you will reach success.\n\n## Tips\n\n* When defining what success looks like, it may be helpful to focus on goal setting from the perspective of the customer and business.  Identify what value or success looks likes for your customer.  Then define what value you are looking to achieve for your business.  \n* The technique forces participants to think about failure, which many teams never do. It's surprising how much you can learn about a domain just by getting participants to share their fears. \n* It's easy to communicate the results of the session in slide ware and project rooms. We'd recommend keeping the results up in the project space throughout your effort.\n\n## Related Practices\n\n* [Impact Mapping](/practice/impact-mapping/) is another practice which leads to the same outputs. Compared to Start At The End, Impact Mapping produces a higher fidelity understanding of the domain, but at the cost of increased complexity for facilitation. Generally speaking, Impact Mapping is the better fit when building products or services, and Start At The End is a better fit when discussing organizational change or other generally nebulous efforts. \n\n## Who do you need?\n\n* Facilitator\n* Product Owner\n* Project Sponsor, both technical and business\n* Architects\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n1-2 hours. The session can be done without any participant prep.\n\n## Difficulty\n\n* Facilitator: Easy\n* Participants: Easy\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\nNone required, but 3x5 sticky notes with markers can be useful if you want participants to jot their notes down independently and then present back.\n\n## How does it fit?\n\n* Typically done in the Why area of the Discovery of the Open Practice Library\n\n## External Resources\n\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>[The Sprint Book](https://www.thesprintbook.com)\n2. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>[Double Diamond design model](https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812)\n3.

      "subtitle": "Connect to your purpose",
      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nWhy are you here? Why does your organisation exist? Is it just to please the shareholders?\n\nYou will have heard the brilliant statement by Harvard marketing professor Theodore Levitt: “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole.” In his book, This Is Marketing, Seth Godin says.\n\n> The lesson is that the drill bit is merely a feature, a means to an end, but what people truly want is the hole it makes.\n>\n> But that doesn’t go nearly far enough. No one wants a hole.\n>\n> What people want is the shelf that will go on the wall once they drill the hole.\n>\n> Actually, what they want is how they’ll feel once they see how uncluttered everything is, when they put their stuff on the shelf that went on the wall now that there’s a quarter-inch hole.\n>\n> But wait…\n>\n> They also want the satisfaction of knowing they did it themselves.\n>\n> Or perhaps the increase in status they’ll get when their spouse admires the the work.\n>\n> Or the peace of mind that comes from knowing that the bedroom isn’t a mess, and that it feels safe and clean.\n>\n> “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill bit. They want to feel safe and respected.”\n\nOrganisations often express their purpose (or their why) in dry terms such as \"maximising shareholder value\" which their customers and employees cannot connect to or be inspired by. For example does an organisation that tells you the weather exist to give you the most accurate, credible extended forecast or are they really there to protect you?\n\nStart with why is a practice to discover your organisation's or your personal why. The \"Why\" is within you and finding your \"Why\" is a process of discovery, not invention.\n\n## Why use it?\n\nPurpose is powerful. Your purpose connects you to other people and creates movements. Your organisation's purpose connects and inspires people. In an world where it is increasingly hard to find and retain talent, your purpose is a powerful differentiator. Purpose drives belief and engagement.\n\nDan Pink, in his book [\"Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us), says that [studies done at MIT and other universities](http://people.duke.edu/~dandan/webfiles/PapersUpside/Large%20Stakes%20Big%20Mistakes.pdf), show that higher pay and bonuses resulted in better performance ONLY if the task consisted of basic, mechanical skills. It worked for problems with a defined set of steps and a single answer. If the task involved cognitive skills, decision-making, creativity, or higher-order thinking, higher pay resulted in lower performance. As a supervisor, you should pay employees enough that they are not focused on meeting basic needs and feel that they are being paid fairly. If you don’t pay people enough, they won’t be motivated. Pink suggests that you should pay enough “to take the issue of money off the table.”\n\nPink says that in order to motivate employees who work beyond basic tasks, give them these three factors to increase performance and satisfaction:\n\n* Autonomy — Our desire to be self directed. It increases engagement over compliance.\n* Mastery — The urge to get better skills.\n* Purpose — The desire to do something that has meaning and is important. Businesses that only focus on profits without valuing purpose will end up with poor customer service and unhappy employees.\n\nWithin all of us is a deep desire for meaning and our organisation's \"Why\" can help our employees and customers connect at a deeper level driving greater engagement.\n\nSimon Sinek says that trust begins to emerge when we see that people and organizations are driven by reasons that go beyond the self-serving. Aligning Why, How and What is a way to build that trust.\n\nCompanies that act like commodity producers have a constant challenge to differentiate themselves from the competition. Chasing the competition, trying to match them feature-for-feature only deepens a “What” culture.\n\nBecause consumers and employees are inspired by “Why” you do what you do, companies that begin communicating with the “Why” have a greater flexibility in the market.\n\nWe’re always competing against someone else. Better quality. More features. Better service. We’re always comparing ourselves to the competition. And no one wants to help us.\n\nWhat if we showed up to work every single day to be better than ourselves? For no better reason than to want to leave the organization in a better state than we found it?\n\nAll organizations start with “Why”, but only the great ones keep their “Why” clear year after year. Those who forget “Why” they were founded show up to the race every day to outdo someone else instead of outdoing themselves.\n\nYou’ve probably heard that before you start a business, market research is key. You do your market research, know your customer and then build your niche. Sinek, however, disagrees. According to Sinek, the “Why” does not come from looking ahead at what you want to achieve and then figuring out an appropriate strategy to get there. It is not born out of market research or for that matter even extensive interviews with customers or employees. It comes from looking in the completely opposite direction from where you are right now. Finding the “Why” is a process of discovery, not invention.\n\nThe “Why” is within you. And once you find and know your “Why”, the hardest part is to remain true to it.\n\n## Vision and Mission Statements\n\nThe difference between “Why” and “How” types also introduces the difference between the vision and mission statements of an organization.\n\nThe vision is the founder’s intent, “Why” the company was founded. The mission is a description of “How” the company will create that future.\n\nWhen both are clear, it will help the “Why” and the “How” type of leaders to have clearly defined roles in the partnership.\n\n# Finding Your Why?\n\nEvery individual or organisation can take a different approach to find their why.\n\nRed Hat used the [Open Decision Framework](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework) across their whole organisation to[ find their why](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/why-open-has-been-red-hat%E2%80%99s-compass-and-purpose-25-years), which is \"Open unlock's the world's potential\".\n\n## Further Information\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA>\n\n<https://simonsinek.com/find-your-why/>\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_With_Why>\n\n<https://www.freshworks.com/freshsales-crm/resources/summary-of-start-with-why-blog/>\\\n\\\n[Case Study: Finding Red Hat's Why](https://opensource.com/open-organization/18/6/explaining-your-why)\n",

      "title": "Story Kick-offs",
      "subtitle": "The act of explaining a story to the pair of developers right before they pick it up.",
      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\n* A joint walkthrough/explanation of the story by the product owner with the pair of developers who will be working on it; right before development starts\n* The developers (and others) use this opportunity to get their questions answered and task out the story or re-validate the tasks.\n* A final check-point to ensure that the scope of the story has not changed or if it has, what to do about it.\n\n## Why use it?\n\n* **Time Lag** - In a Sprint Planning Meeting, the team ends up discussing the various stories that are likely to be picked up next. There might be a time lag between this discussion and when the story is actually picked up which leads to a loss of context. This is usually due to real world factors like carried over stories, critical bug fixes, leaves etc. \n* **Lack of deep dive** - In addition, during an IPM, the in-depth story deep-dive may not have happened (this depends on the team and the project) due to a number of reasons like time pressure, pending decisions etc. \n* **Change in context** - Even if a deep-dive has happened and technical tasks have been detailed out, the context may have changed between the IPM and the time the story was actually picked up. \n\n_A story kick-off gives the opportunity to both refresh the need as well as perform a more in-depth analysis/validation of the story._\f\n\n## How to do it?\n\n**Pre-requisites**\n\n* **Story** - The Product Owner should have the story ready with the analysis done. This means that the goals, users & value of the story should be clear. Acceptance criteria & assumptions should also be present. In addition, mock-ups, data, scripts etc may be required depending on the context of the project.\n* **Participants** - Ideally, the pair of developers who is going to work on the story and the quality analyst(s) who will be testing it are required at a minimum. Sometimes, there might be the need to bring the User Experience designer or UI Developer or people with specific skill-sets relevant to delivering the story. The Product Owner or the person who has written the story should be present to do the kick-off.\n\n**Time**\n\n* **Duration** - If this is the first story in a feature, the whole team may need to be invited so that everyone is on the same page. Usually, the first few stories in a feature tend to require a lot more preparation and time to explain. Once this is done and the team is familiar with the feature, the time taken reduces quite a bit. Do the kick-off before the developers actually start working on it. \n* **Timing** - A common mistake is to do a kick-off at the end of the day, before lunch, before an IPM or before either of the developers have finished working on their current story. If this happens, it means that some portion of the value of the kick-off is diminished since the purpose i.e. focus on the story, is diluted.\n\n**Execution**\n\n* **Explanation** - Walk the developers and the QA(s) through the actual story narrative, clearly explaining the context of the story as well as the acceptance criteria\n* **Supporting Artefacts** - It might be better to keep the application open in a window, the story itself in another with supporting materials like sequences etc. in another. Have pen and paper ready or be next to a whiteboard because nothing beats an explanation with writing/drawing. Pictures of your collaborative explanation can be taken and attached to the story if this is of value.\n* **Questions** - Typically, there will be questions even for the most simplest of stories. Most of these questions can be answered easily if the analysis is clear. There might be minor modifications to stories based on the inputs from the developers/QA(s). Conversation outcomes should be captured in the story for later reference. \n* **Roadblocks** - Sometimes, there might be questions which require more analysis or conversations with other stakeholders. In these cases, the team can take a call on whether to proceed with the story while excluding scope related to the question or parking the story itself until the questions are answered.\n\n##\n",

Teams will make new story point estimates based on the actual work done to complete a story, then compare that to the original estimation and calculate an Accuracy Differential for each completed story. Individuals can talk about why they thought a story was larger/smaller than originally estimated. \n\n## Why use it?\n\nStory RePointing helps to keep teams conscious about their pointing decisions, and may help the team to improve their accuracy over time. \n\n## Materials:\n\n* Whiteboard\n* TV or laptops for all team members\n* Post Its\n* Value Cards\n* Dry Erase Markers\n\n## Instructions:\n\n1. Draw a grid similar to the image above\n   _Include Story Identifiers, Reviewed Value, Original Value, Differential_\n2. Distribute Value Cards\n3. Conceal the Original Values from the team under a Post-It, or marker the values in\n4. Share screens with your team via individual laptops, or a TV – ensure all team members are able to view and read all details of each Story, but cannot see any pointing details\n5. Begin at the top of the story list, giving the team ~1 minute to read over the story and details, when everyone is ready, ask them at a prompt to hold up their chosen Value Card\n6. Average the Value Cards and record it\n7. Display/write the Original Value and calculate the Differential and record it\n8. Ask the individual(s) who was/were assigned or completed the story to explain why they chose the value they did if it differed from the original estimation.\n9. Ask others whose chosen values differed from the original value why they felt it was a larger/smaller story than originally selected\n10. Continue until all stories have been RePointed\n11. Record in Excel and use it to track accuracy over time as below\n\n![Excel Estimation Tracker Example](/images/estmation-tracker.jpg \"Estimation Tracker Example\")\n\n## Thoughts:\n\n_Use Value Cards of varying sizes from the smallest story to the largest i.e. \\[Use Point Cards (1, 2, 3, 5 etc.) or Sizing Cards (S, M, L, XL, etc.)]_\n\n_Using Sizing Cards may spark additional discussion by compelling teammates to ask one another what the equivalent point values are to the sizes, and also stimulate thought via mental translation from size to point value._\n\n_You will get a feel for when everyone is has made a valuation of the story being RePointed quickly - body language usually is enough, but confirming with a \"Ready?\" ensures everyone has had time to read through the story and its details and make a valuation_\n",

Complexity leads to a poor understanding of a system, which in turn can make the task of modifying or even using the system very challenging. The complexity of a system is reflected in its descriptions and documentation. The task of explaining a system to an audience of non technical people can be daunting. The System Diagram provides a simple method to solve this problem.\n\nIdentifying and describing all the components of a System Diagram should enable a team to get a good understanding of the system. If the diagram is too complex, perhaps it needs to be broken down into multiple integrated systems.\n\n## How to use it?\n\n1. Gather the team around a blank whiteboard\n2. Begin by drawing a large box in the middle of the canvas; this is your **System Boundary**\n3. As a team, define the main **Purpose** of the system in one brief sentence and write it above the box\n\n   * If you struggle to define the Purpose in just one sentence, then the system might be too complex to describe, and you'll need to split it into multiple systems and diagrams\n4. Define one or more **Inputs** that the system will receive from external actors\n5. Define one or more **Outputs** that the system will provide to external actors\n6. Define one or more **Subsystems** that are inside the Boundar; these typically process the inputs, but may perform other tasks as well\n7.

Consensing aims at the consideration of all voices of a group, including those of the reserved or silent group members.\nThe group members first develop as many suggestions as possible. After that, for each proposal its objection is measured by the whole group. The proposals are sorted according to this objection. Consensing does not require agreement, affirmation or even preference.

What will you see in practice in general?\n\n* The group discusses the individual options until individuals give up in frustration and ultimately the solution is decided by the toughest people. For the group, this process is often very frustrating and contributes to a poor image of group decisions. The willingness to engage in discussion in the future is decreasing. This means **Consensus by fatigue and is sort of decision by resignation**.  \n* Someone in the group takes the lead and takes a path - and likes to do it with his fist on the table. While this solution means that ultimately one person dominates the entire group, many may be happy that someone saves them from the endless discussions. You can call this **the boss decides**.\n* The group decides on formal \"majority voting\" between the options. At the same time, valuable concerns may not be heard. **Though this method of decision finding is formally legitimated by the group there is the danger that the possible potential is not exhausted.**\n  \nA completely different approach is systemic consensing, hopefully overcoming the drawbacks by a creative process. \n\n## How does it work?\nThe approach has a few different phases:\n\n1. **Determine the question for the problem that has surfaced.** \nA group wants to make a decision that is shared by everyone involved. The group develops a question that can not be answered with yes or no. But it may also be that the question is already in the room and only needs to be formulated.\n\n1. **Creative phase: Collecting solutions** (for example as a brainstorming). \nIn the second phase, proposals for solutions are made, paying attention to creativity and diversity. All ideas and wishes may be brought forward and stand side by side on an equal footing. The proposed solutions are not commented and discussed in this phase.\n\n1. **Assessment phase.** In the this phase, each solution proposal is assessed by each group member with so-called \"resistance points\" (R-points). Zero points means \"no resistance\" or \"I can support this solution\". The highest score to be awarded is ten and means \"strong resistance\" or \"I strongly disagree with this proposal\". The rating is recorded on a matrix. \n\n1. **Evaluation Phase.** Finally, the points awarded by the participants are added together for each proposed solution. The lowest score solution has the least resistance in the group and is therefore closest to consensus.\n\n### Additional hints\nWhen collecting the options it is sensible, to add a so called \"zero option\" which is context specific. It is normally phrased as \"leave everything as it is\", \"let's decide next time\", ... The zero option can be considered as „limit of reasonability“. No proposal has a chance of being accepted by the group, if the rank of the zero option is lower than all others.\n\nIf you interpret the highest rankings for options (ten) as \"veto\" (like: 'I'll resign immediately if we do this') it is advisable not to accept the option with lowest rank if one of the group members has \"vetoed\" agaist it. One can ask what the participant needs, so that his resistance is reduced. Often solutions are found here, but sometimes the person is already happy that the group is aware of his resistance.\n\nEven if two solutions have almost equally low results, it's worth taking a closer look. Maybe one of the solutions was pushed from the outside and the other in the group. Then one could reconcile these two solutions again.  \n\nYou can also use different metrics than a 0 - 10 scale. \n\nFor the process to work, it is important that the participants understand it well. This can be achieved by a test run with a simple question. \n\n> In practice I gave a group for a training a 10 euro note asking them how to spend that money - and drive their decision with systemic concensing. I think the surprise ( - are you honest? You really give us that money? - ) helped to put the group members in a state where they could discuss the quetion unbiased. This also showed how unrealistic power options by e specific participant ( - give the money to me - ) are handled.   \n\n## Prerequisites\n* All participants should be affected to the more or less the same amount\n* All must have more or less the same information concerning the problem\n* Flipchart or whiteboard or the like for the visualization of the results\n\n\n## Further Information\nBy \"consensing\" we mean the creative process of finding the best possible approximation of consensus, that is, the greatest possible agreement among people. \"Systemic\" we call the process described here, because it systemically leads to a constructive and cooperative behavior of all parties without being dependent on their goodwill or other qualities.\n\"Systemic Consensing\" was first developed and described by the Germans Visotschnig and Schrotta, they published 2005 a book ([\"Das SK Prinzip - Wie man Konflikte ohne Machtkämpfe löst\"](http://www.amazon.de/SK-Prinzip-Konflikte-ohne-Machtk%C3%A4mpfe-l%C3%B6st/dp/3800070960/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1291638226&sr=1-1)) about this way of decision finding.\n\nThere is a free ebook in German language [\"Einführung in systemisches Konsensieren\"](http://www.sk-prinzip.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Einführung-in-systemisches-Konsensieren.pdf) .\n\n\n",

They enable the team to quickly discuss where one or more team members is suddenly troubled by the direction their work is going and can also provide an information radiator to assess the overall team health and feeling.\n\nTeam sentiment practices are often introduced where there is a strong sense of servant leadership in the working environment.\n\n\n## Related Practices\n\nWhere the team has used the [Social Contract](/practice/social-contract/) practice, team sentiment practices can help enforce some of the feeling radiated in the Social Contract.\n\n[Retrospectives](/practice/realtime-retrospective/) are excellent check-points on the team health and taking the opportunity to review the Team Sentiment artefcts can facilitate a team conversation as to how they can improve overall team mood and what has been learned in the recent iteration.\n\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- Someone to introduce and facilitate the team sentiment practice(s).\n- A cross functional team to continously use the practice. Multiple teams can each use their own practice and multiple resulting artefacts can be used to roll up and radiate wider organisational moood trends.\n\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n- 5-10 minutes to introduce and make first use of the practice.\n- Ad hoc updates performed on an ongoing basis (with facilitator driving the continuous adoption, use and value of the practice).\n\n## Difficulty\n\n- Facilitator - Medium\n- Participants - Easy\n\n## How does it fit?\n\n- Typically done in the Culture and Collaboration area of the Foundation of the Open Practice Library\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\nTo use \"Mood Marbles\" as the Team Sentiment practice\n- A number of containers to hold enough marbles (can be drawings of containers on large flip-chart paper)\n- Red and Green Marbles (can be sticky notes) to start with. Other colors can be introduced.\n\n## How To\n\nMood Marble containers are placed in a strategic place where all team members will see and walk pass regularly (for example, near the door or on the way to the bathroom).\n\nTeam are encouraged to think about their current mood. Start with positive (green) and negative (red) and each team member adds a marble to the container that reflects their mood.\n\nTeam members are regularly reminded they can change their mood marble at any time.\n\n\n## External References\n\nDigital Mood Marble Board\n\n\n1.

      "title": "Team Workspaces",
      "subtitle": "How to create the right workspace(s) for high-performing teams",
      "body": "\n# What is it?\n\nThis article contains a collection of best practices and lessons learned from real facilities build-out of global, permanent labs facilities, as well as experiences building temporary, ‘pop-up’ team spaces. \n\n# Why use it?\n\nIntentionally designing workspace can greatly influence the way your teams can get things done.\n\n# Overall Space Recommendations\n\n## Open Plan\n\nThe open workspace plan allows for open, immediate, and constant inter / intra communication among teams and team members.  The open workspace offers a professional environment fostering creativity and collaboration amongst multiple teams. \n\nThe open plan space should be big enough to accommodate for the whole team to sit  together without being separated from distance, walls or objects, which makes the interactions hard.\n\nThe space should also allow for additional people (support acts, visitors, users) to be seated next to the team.\n\nA dedicated open plan space works best, especially if it allows the reviews to happen in the same space. This way visitors for the reviews can literally see the work of the team and any questions during the review can be directly answered by pulling in some of the artefacts.\n\nIn shared open plan spaces, where the team will be seated next to other teams one should consider 2 important aspects:\n\n* Confidentiality - if the work and information required to complete or test designs is alright for 3rd party people - if they overhear or see something.\n* Noise - the team can both be the source of big noise for other teams or suffer from such. We have had experience where the team was forced to go into a meeting room for every discussion even if not too loud as the open plan space was considered a quiet area too. This was highly disruptive and hindered seriously progress and teamwork.\n\n## Wall Space (Windows/Glass Walls)\n\nIn order to [visualize teams’ work](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/visualisation-of-work/), it is vital that a large amount of wall space is available. Throughout product development efforts, different information radiators will be used to clearly show the work being done. This will allow for anyone in or outside of the project to quickly get a complete status of where things stand by ‘walking the walls’. Visual cues are strongly preferred over storing status in computer systems when possible. \n\nWall space is often used as working wall space for paper & foil. The landlord or company operating the space should agree on the use of the walls for whiteboards and working areas, i.e. handing foil, boards, paper, applying sticky notes, etc.\n\nThere needs to be enough free space for stand-ups next to the walls (next to a Scrum Board, Backlog board or standing in front of a wall turned into a whiteboard using foil)\n\nJust about the same is valid for windows as for the walls above. \n\n## Flexible Spaces\n\nWe prefer spaces that can be re-configured as needed to support different team and program-level activities. Putting desks on rollers, using foldable desks and stackable chairs, and generally creating the ability to create different workspaces is a good practice. See Make Space for design inspiration around flexible workspaces.\n\nIt should be possible for the team to move around boards - in and out of their core space, e.g. moving boards to flexible spaces, breakout areas, meeting rooms. \n\n## Breakout Areas\n\nBreakout areas are multi-purpose spaces. They can be used for informal ad-hoc meetings, eating, or general relaxation. The are ideal for brainstorming and breakout sessions. They provide a more creative setting than traditional meeting rooms and ideally should have internet connectivity and power outlets.\n\n* Advantages - Provides instant-access meeting facilities for teams, ideally should be located within or adjacent to the open workspace area. \n* Disadvantages - Can be noisy and not ideal for certain types of meetings e.g. client facing, sensitive, etc.\n\nIt should be possible for the team to move around boards - in and out of their core space, e.g. moving boards to flexible spaces, breakout areas, meeting rooms. \n\n## Meeting Spaces\n\n* Available big breakout room for Lunch & Learn sessions or workshops to host up to 20\n* Available room for Sprint Reviews, which can hold up to 20-25 people seated \n* Available bigger room for the Demo Day event to host between 30-50 people\n* Smaller meeting rooms for ad hoc discussions to avoid noise in the team space.\n* Call booths/pods for calls\n\n## Quiet Zones\n\nQuiet Zones are critical to the successful implementation of an open workplace setting. They provide a areas where workers can get privacy and quiet to perform work that may be personal or confidential or requires additional focus or attention.\n\n* Advantages - Provide on-demand quiet spaces for anyone on the team.\n* Disadvantages - If rules are not put into place the areas can be ‘hijacked’ by non-team members\n\n## Hoteling Spaces\n\nHotel spaces provide  overflow work space to accommodate remote team members, vendors, etc. who may be visiting the office but are not their permanently. They are often incorporated with break out areas.\n\n* Advantages - They allow for flexible work spaces to accommodate spikes in workplace occupancy.\n* Disadvantages - They are typically smaller than normal team workspaces and are not designed for long-term or permanent use.\n\n## Work Environment\n\n* ‎Coffee - free, quality brew\n* Water fountain\n* The team space should allow for some working \"mess\" as the paper and post-its on the wall and whiteboards need to remain up till the end of the residency.\n* Cleaning services should NOT touch, displace or remove any items from the room, even if on the ground - sometimes post-it notes may fall off the boards and putting them away may cause serious disruption to the work\n* Easy access at all times of day - should not restrict early starts and late end of the day\n* ‎It is OK to rearrange furniture, take out or add such, rearrange tables, etc.\n* ‎Whiteboards in meeting rooms - big whiteboards, i.e. at least 2m long\n\n## Visualization of Work\n\n* Must have sufficient wall space to visualize work\n* Space to hang/display boards (e.g. Scrum board) next to the team in a visible way - e.g. the Backlog, the Scrum board, the Event Storming / MBPM boards. This should be done in a way that  the whole team can see the boards without having to get up and move from their seat \n* See [this practice](https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/practices/visualisation-of-work/) for more details.\n\n## Video cameras\n\nWeb Cameras are critical to successful remote work and meetings, etc. As more vendors, third parties, and remote employees are involved in the work, being able to see each other offers a sense of inclusivity \n\nWe recommend [Meeting Owl cameras](https://www.owllabs.com/) for 360-degree video conferencing. The microphone on the Owl is not ideal, and can be supplemented with a separate mic when needed.\n\n## Desks / Chairs / Storage\n\n* Desk should be big enough for allowing two people to sit next to each other in front of a screen - pair programming, pair reviews, user interviews, etc.\n* Visitor chairs should be available, especially if the team space is used also as a space for Sprint  Reviews\n* Secured storage (shared) is required for many of the Labs in a box supplies to be stored - hardware (cameras, projectors, etc.), post it notes, moving boxes (boards) The secure storage is required for high-value items as cameras, mobile devices, etc.\n* As much as possible, make the items in the room moveable. Put everything on casters if possible, to be able to reconfigure the space. Flexibility of re-configuration is preferable to high fit-and-finish.\n* Folding desks provide the ability to clear out a space (though you must allow those desks not to be tethered down via power/network cables.\n* Standing desks are growing in popularity and prove to help with both productivity and employees physical wellbeing. \n* Enough seats to host team and SME or other experts, users or customers visiting\n* Presentations / Projectors / Screens\n* Small but powerful portable projectors are useful for ad-hoc flexibility\n* Creston / AirMedia equipment does not work with Linux\n* 2 big screens for the pipelines dashboard and presentations (reviews, mob learning, etc.) - projectors cannot be used for pipeline dashboards as this one is on for the whole time and can easily burn the projector\n* ‎External screens for developers - dual screen (laptop and external screen) has a big impact on developer productivity and is really important when pair programming is practiced as laptops do not provide a size suitable for 2 pair of eyes in front\n\n## Networking & Energy\n\n* Labs consumes higher amount of wireless and wired bandwidth than a typical office\n* Avoid hardwiring the networking to individual desks\n* Being able to use wifi and laptops instead of ethernet connectivity. This allows for fluid team mobility and self-organization\n* No filters or restrictions of the network, e.g. some enterprises would restrict access to the Google Suite of applications or not allow VPN connections\n* Having a backup connection, e.g. a 4G router\n* Have a SLA and an escalation path in case of network issues (e.g. intermittent connectivity) to prevent loss of time and agenda disruption as we work in very short sprints\n* Enough power supply sockets - that is roughly 3 per seat (laptop, external screen, mobile device/camera)\n* No restriction to number of IPs - we may consume a lot of IPs as each developer is likely to use more than 2 devices and there might be many visitors - we had issues with networks allowing only for as much as 1 IP per member of the team, which cut off visitors and additional devices\n\n## Phone\n\n* Wireless phones can provide great flexibility (used at WeWork spaces)\n\n## Printer\n\n* We typically use a shared printer, and do not dedicate one in the Labs space, to save space\n\n## Aesthetics\n\n* ‘Unfinished’ space (exposed cabling, exposed walls, etc) provides a new and different aesthetic that feels different than a corporate space, and implies that we are building new prototypes.\n* Consider avoiding the excessive use of corporate logos, branding, and color schemes. We specifically created a new color scheme for our space that did not match the corporate aesthetic, to imply that we are operating differently than our typical work areas, and to encourage creative thinking\n\n## Other Nice-to-Haves\n\n* Good restaurants / canteen / lunch options for the whole team nearby\n* Movable large whiteboards\n* Mouses and keyboards\n* Plant life\n* Portable / Bluetooth speaker for music, especially for after-hours coding, hackathons, workshops\n* Wellness room / quiet space for anyone that needs it\n\n# Other References\n\n* [Make Space - Recommended Stanford d.school book](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/make-space-excerpts)\n* [RedMonk article on Labs spaces](https://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2017/05/18/innovate-disrupt-lab-space-cluster/)\n* [Video of London Open Innovation Labs space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcPjOjPGa_g)\n* [Blog post about logo and design of Boston space](https://openstudio.redhat.com/open-innovation-labs-wall-graphic/)\n* [Boston Red Hat Open Innovation Labs office tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_Y2Gwaj7Gs)\n* [Facebook live tour of Boston Open Innovation Labs facility](https://www.facebook.com/RedHatInc/videos/10155135021225330/)\n",

Requirements are turned into test cases, then the software is developed to pass the tests. In other words, it creates a safety net that serves to keep the developer's problems or bugs at bay while enabling the developer to refactor efficiently. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements.\n\n## Why use it?\n\n* Allows developers to create smaller units of improvement as initially code should only aim to pass the tests.\n* Leads to more modular and flexible code as it will be developed in smaller independent units.\n* Generates faster feedback, for example by telling you whether your last change (or refactoring) has broken some previously working code.\n* Creates a detailed specification.\n\n## Further Information\n\n* Wikipedia definition of [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n* [Programmer Test Principles](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/programmer-test-principles-d01c064d7934) by Kent Beck.\n",

On the right, you agree; on the left, you disagree,\n* The vertical axis represents how the principle is applied to your organization. \"Applied\" at the top, \"not applied\" at the bottom,\n* You will now position Deming's 14 Management Principles by placing their numbers on a 2x2 matrix. Each team member uses a different color.\n* After placing each principle, the facilitator asks the outliers to explain their position.\n* The facilitator asks the group if it inspires some ideas for the team.\n\n_You can use the tool as a self-reflection one. As a facilitator, it is useful to try the exercise first by yourself to be able to pick the principles that will most resonate with your team._\n## Further Information\n* [Deming's 14 Management Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming#Key_principles).\n* This practice was first published in [Changing Your Team From The Inside](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40692351-changing-your-team-from-the-inside)\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\n* A UI workshop is an activity in which participants quickly sketch rough ideas for the user interface.\n* These ideas can be written on a whiteboard, sticky notes, or sheets of paper. (A tall sticky note makes a great template for a mobile screen.)\n* The workshop can be run with just a facilitator and a UX designer, but including the entire team is even better.\n* At the end of the workshop, the participants can vote by adding dots to their favorites.\n* Later, the best \"low-fidelity\" designs can serve as the basis for interactive prototypes or more complete designs.\n\n## Why use it?\n\n* UI design workshops help take a high-level business process (such as an [event storm](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/event-storming/)) and turn it into something concrete that developers can begin working on.\n* This activity generates new ideas and builds shared understanding, particularly if the entire team participates.\n* Jump-start development by creating just enough design for the team to begin working.\n* A quick, rewarding activity like this one builds confidence and experience in team members who might be new to user experience design.\n* Participants can produce the design assets they need to move forward, even if the team does not have a dedicated UX designer.\n\n## How to Facilitate\n\n1. Describe what we're sketching:\n  - User goal\n  - What size sticky\n  - Mobile-first?\n  - How long they have\n  - Use multiple stickies to depict the user flow\n2. Everyone sketches - 10 min\n3. Playback from each person (and put stickies on board) - 2 min per person\n4. Gather feedback - 2-3 min per each person's flow (green/red stickies with comments on what exactly they like/dislike)\n5. Another round of sketching - 5-7 min\n6. Mark each screen with a letter and number\n7. More playback - 2 min per person (tell everyone to write down the letter/number combo of what they like)\n8. Merge based on the votes/bingo\n\n### Alternate facilitation style\n\nInstead of merging the designs in steps 6-8, ask the team to dot vote on elements of each deisgn. A UX designer can then use those sketches as inspiration for more detailed wireframes.\n\n## Further Information\n\n* [Wireflows: A UX Deliverable for Workflows and Apps](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wireflows/)\n* [3 rapid prototyping exercises to improve your UX skills](https://uxdesign.cc/3-rapid-prototyping-exercises-to-improve-your-skills-in-ux-design-f2c8b2d690b3)\n* [The \"Tuesday\" portion of the book _Sprint_](https://library.gv.com/sprint-week-tuesday-d22b30f905c3) provides some great ideas for facilitating a UI design workshop.\n* [Sketches from the gnome-software design sprint](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/issues/451) show \"dot voting\" on favorite designs.\n* [Agile UX Sketching](https://gamestorming.com/1269/#more-1269) routine on Gamestorming.com\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it? \nIn a usability testing session, the team observes real users interacting with the product. Typically, a facilitator sits with a user and asks her to complete tasks and explain her thinking as she goes. The team sits in a separate room and observes the testing by video.\n\nA usability test is _not a focus group_; it's focused on what the user thinks and does in the real world.\n\nA usability test can be run on an existing product, a prototype, or even a competitor's product! The prototype could be working code, or it could be something as simple as a few clickable images. Test early and often to create products that delight users and solve real needs.\n\n## Why use it? \n- Something that's obvious to someone who has been working on a product might be confusing to a user.\n- What we think users need might not be what they actually need.\n- What _users_ think they need may not be what they actually need!\n- Usability testing can help answer questions such as, \"Are we on the right track?\", \"What problems do we need to solve?\", or \"Which features should we build first?\"\n- With early feedback from real users, teams can avoid sinking time into a feature that's confusing or not useful.\n- Watching real people use a product builds empathy and understanding - which is why it's important to include the entire team.\n\n## Further Information\n- [User Testing: Why & How (Jakob Nielsen)](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/user-testing-jakob-nielsen/)\n- [Steve Krug's usability test script](https://sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html)\n- [The art of guerrilla usability testing](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/the-art-of-guerrilla-usability-testing/)\n- [UX Prototypes: Low Fidelity vs. High Fidelity](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-prototype-hi-lo-fidelity/)\n- [Usability Testing](http://opendesignkit.org/methods/usability-testing/) from Open Design Kit\n- [Rocket Surgery Made Easy](https://www.sensible.com/rsme.html)\n- [Objectified: Smart Design OXO Good Grips Story](https://vimeo.com/106963722)\n",

      "body": "\n\n## What is it?\n\nUser Story Mapping is an evolution of the traditional Agile backlog, made popular by Jeff Patton in 2008[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1). It's an effective practice for creating lightweight release plans that can drive standard Agile delivery practices. At the end of user story mapping, you should have:\n\n- A backlog of scope items (captured as stories or simply feature titles) the team believes can be delivered in the planning window. This means some items will be placed out of scope\n- The backlog \"sliced\" into ~3 iterations, such that it forms the outline of plan\n- Enough detail in the first iteration of the plan to get started with the work\n\n\n## Why use User Story Mapping?\n\n- No one likes estimating work effort, but it's an important step in many environments. User Story Mapping presents an approach to estimation that many teams find much more tolerable than practices like planning poker or t-shirt sizing\n- Many projects have a natural progression of work from beginning, middle to end. This progression is often lost in a traditional flat backlog. User Story Mapping captures this information with a lightweight mechanism to plan out more than one iteration (i.e. an Agile release plan)\n- User Story Mapping presents backlog items in the context of the overall business process so you don't lose sight of \"the big picture\", a common pitfall in Scrum projects\n\n\n## Related Practices\n\n- User Story Mapping is a great way to create an Agile delivery plan for a business process designed with [Event Storming](/practice/event-storming/)\n- Program Increment Planning[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2) in Scaled Agile Framework leverages many of the ideas behind User Story Mapping\n- Site Mapping[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3) should provide the backbone of the User Story Map in UI driven projects\n\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- Facilitator (if the team is new to the approach)\n- Product Owner\n- User Experience Design\n- Analysts\n- Developers\n- Testers\n\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n- ~4 Hours not including breaks\n- Facilitate in small sessions @ around ~90 minutes each\n- Session can be done on different days\n\n\n## Difficulty\n- Facilitator: Easy\n- Participants: Easy\n\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n- Drawing paper roll[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4). Stickies tend to fall off walls otherwise.\n- 3 different colors of wide format sticky notes like the 4x6 sticky notes[<sup>5</sup>](#footnote-5)\n- 2 different colors of small square sticky notes like the 3x3 sticky notes[<sup>6</sup>](#footnote-6)\n- Markers\n\n\n## How does it fit?\n\n- Typically done in the Outcomes area of the Discovery of the Open Practice Library\n\n## External Resources\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>[User Story Mapping by Jeff Patton in 2008](http://jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/)\n2. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>[Program Increment Planning](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/pi-planning/) by SAFe\n3. <a name=\"footnote-3\"></a>[Site Mapping](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/site-mapping/) by 18f\n4. <a name=\"footnote-4\"></a>[Drawing Paper example](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80324072/)\n5. <a name=\"footnote-5\"></a>[4x6 sticky notes example](https://www.amazon.com/Post-Sticky-Janeiro-Collection-4621-SSAU/dp/B001UXFT70)\n6. <a name=\"footnote-6\"></a>[3x3 sticky notes example](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1UE0JY?psc=1)\n7. <a name=\"footnote-7\"></a>[Double Diamond design model](https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812)\n8.

Good Ideas\n\nAnyone who comes up with a good idea is awarded the Unicorn.  Anyone can award the Unicorn to others and there is no limit to the number of times you can be awarded the Unicorn.  If you are awarded the Unicorn, you are given a +1 against your name on the board.\n\n2. Disruptive Behaviour\n\nIf someone is being disruptive to the meeting, being difficult or generally derailing the discussions then they are awarded the Skunk.

If you are awarded the Skunk, you are given -3 against your name on the board.\n\n3. Rat Holing\n\nIf someone leads the conversation down a 'rat hole', then they are awarded the Rat.  Like the Unicorn and the Skunk, anyone can award the Rat to others and there is no limit to the number of times you can be awarded the Rat.  If you are awarded the Rat, you are given -1 against your name on the board.\n\nAt the end of the meeting/workshop the points are added up, deducted and the person with the most points is awarded a prize.

      "body": "\n\n## What is Visualisation of Work?\n\nThis practice involves radiating and visually representing all aspects of work. Information that is useful to team members, stakeholders and users is physically presented on walls, windows, doors and other flat surfaces and positioned in the line of sight of those people who will get value from consuming the information.\n\nThe \"Information Radiator\" is an artefact that is used to physically provide information to one or more people.\n\nThe activity of \"Walking the Walls\" is where someone interested in the work can walk around the physical space the associated team(s) are working from and get all the information they need from inspecting artefacts on the wall and from the resulting conversations.\n\n\n## Why Visualise work?\n\nVisualising work helps facilitate a transparent and open way of working. It helps avoid hiding information about status, progress, direction, challenges and opportunities related to a product. Traditionally such information is held in files on shared drives (for example, spreadsheets of project plans, powerpoint slides, word documents, etc.) which has the challenge of not being accessible or known about and, if found, not being up-to-date.\n\nWhere important information is constantly accessible and visible to people, both speed and accuracy of their work can improve with reduced wastage from having to search for information. It is also more likely that the information is accurate because people are continuously being reminded of it.\n\n![Visualisation of Work](/images/visualisation-of-work.png)\n\n## Related Practices\n\nPractices we use that result in information radiators which we use to visualise work include:\n\n- [Impact Mapping](/practice/impact-mapping/)\n- [Event Storming](/practice/event-storming/)\n- [Value Stream Mapping and Metric Based Process Mapping](/practice/vsm-and-mbpm/)\n- Target Outcomes\n- [Social Contact](/practice/social-contract/)\n- [User Story Mapping](/practice/user-story-mapping/)\n- Product Backlogs\n- Sprint Boards\n- [Burndown](/practice/burndown/) and Burnup Charts\n- Build Monitors\n- CI/CD monitors\n- Retrospectives\n- [Realtime Retrospective](/practice/realtime-retrospective/)\n- [Team Sentiment](/practice/team-sentiment/)\n\n\n## Who do you need?\n\n- A facilitator (such as a Scrum Master) to drive transparent ways of working.\n- The full team who are responsible for delivering the work visualised.\n- Interested stakeholders to consume information and feed back on it.\n\n\n## Suggested Time\n\n- 5-10 minutes to produce each information radiator and start it radiating.\n- Ad hoc updates performed on an ongoing basis with the facilitator driving the continuous consumption of and feedback from the information being presented.\n\n\n## Difficulty\n\n- Facilitator - Medium\n- Participants - Easy\n\n## How does it fit?\n\n- Tyipcally done in the Culture and Collaboration are of the Foundation of the Open Practice Library\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\n- Flip chart paper\n- Magic Whiteboard charts\n- Writable walls\n- Flip chart and white board pens\n- Stickie notes (all shapes, sizes and colors)\n- Sharpie pens\n- Large monitor / TV screens\n- Small computers to radiate dashboards (e.g. CI/CD monitors)\n\n\n## How To\n\n- Consider the positioning of all information radiators and who will have line of sight\n- Consider use of color coding across different information radiators (for example, same color stickies to represent features)\n- Allow sufficient time to produce high quality information radiators that will inspire and drive interest\n- Introduce the information radiator to all those who will use it (either in contributing to it and/or consuming information from it)\n- Encourage continuous inspection and update to the information presented\n\n![Visualisation of Work](/images/visualisation-of-work2.png)\n\n## External References\n\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>[Information Radiator by Alistair Cockburn](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Information+radiator)\n2. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>[98 Visualisation Examples by Jimmy Janlén](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/9188063011/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  \n",

They work in tandem, where VSM is designed to view the big, macro picture and make strategic decisions with executives, and MBPM is designed to view the detailed, micro picture and make tactical improvements with front line workers. The first generation of these techniques comes from Toyota's \"information and material flow\" (as documented in Lean Thinking[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) and the second generation from Learning to See[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2).\n\n## Why use VSM & MBPM?\n\nIn the context of software delivery, VSM & MBPM are excellent tools to holistically analyze and optimize \"brownfield\" delivery processes, including everything from requirements definition, infrastructure provisioning and application development.\n\nBeing derived from Lean Manufacturing, VSM & MBPM visually represent the way work flows through an organization, at both a macro and micro level, from the time a customer requests a good/service, until the time a customer receives the good/service. When used together, these tools are particularly effective at:\n\n* Building shared understanding throughout the various levels of an organization on how work is actually done\n* Creating the urgency for improvement\n* Formulating specific, data driven improvement plans\n* Preventing \"improvement\" work in a particular area that leads to sub-optimization for the entire value stream / process\n\n## Facilitation Materials Needed\n\nSome teams prefer whiteboards, but the most common approach uses paper and PostIts\n\n* Drawing paper roll[<sup>3</sup>](#footnote-3).\n* Different colored wide format sticky notes like the 4x6 sticky notes[<sup>4</sup>](#footnote-4)\n* Markers for the PostIts\n* Charcoal pencil and eraser[<sup>5</sup>](#footnote-5) to draw lines between PostIts\n* For MBPM; chalk line can be useful, but not required\n\n## How does it fit?\n\nBoth VSM & MBPM document a current state map, and then design a future state map for subsequent implementation.\n\n* The current state map is typically done in the Why area of the Discovery of the Open Practice Library.\n* The future state map is typically done as part of the Outcomes area of the Discoery of the Open Practice Library.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n### Start With\n\n* [Webinar](https://vimeo.com/149407030) and [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/KarenMartinGroup/vsmmbpmwhenyouoptforeach) from Karen Martin's Value Stream Mapping and Process Mapping: When to Use Each\n\n### VSM Specific Resources\n\n* [Book](https://www.ksmartin.com/books/value-stream-mapping/) by Karen Martin and Mike Osterling\n* [List of Webinars](https://www.ksmartin.com/webinar/value-stream-mapping/) by Karen Martin\n* [Value Streams are Made of People](https://lizkeogh.com/value-streams-are-made-of-people/) by Liz Keogh\n\n### MBPM Specific Resources\n\n* [Webinar](https://vimeo.com/54601924) and [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/KarenMartinGroup/metricsbased-process-mapping-what-when-how) from Karen Martin's Metrics-Based Process Mapping: What, When & How\n* [List of Webinars](https://www.ksmartin.com/webinar/metrics-based-process-mapping/) by Karen Martin\n\n## External References\n\n1. <a name=\"footnote-1\"></a>[Lean Thinking](https://www.lean.org/BookStore/ProductDetails.cfm?SelectedProductID=88)\n2. <a name=\"footnote-2\"></a>[Learning to See](https://www.lean.org/Bookstore/ProductDetails.cfm?SelectedProductId=9)\n3. <a name=\"footnote-3\"></a>[Drawing Paper example](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80324072/)\n4. <a name=\"footnote-4\"></a>[4x6 sticky notes example](https://www.amazon.com/Post-Sticky-Janeiro-Collection-4621-SSAU/dp/B001UXFT70)\n5. <a name=\"footnote-5\"></a>[charcoal pencil and eraser example](https://www.amazon.com/Studio-25-Piece-Drawing-Artists-Charcoal/dp/1441310207)\n6. <a name=\"footnote-6\"></a>[Double Diamond design model](https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/how-to-apply-a-design-thinking-hcd-ux-or-any-creative-process-from-scratch-b8786efbf812)\n",

It is a drawing of multiple concentric circles, each of which represents an additional layer of details for the product/service. At the core are the generic product/service characteristics (features), followed by minimal conditions circle (must haves), an augmented product circle, a potential circle (differentiations and customer retention features) and additional circles if required.\n\n![Whole Product Canvas](/images/whole-product.jpg)\n\n## Why use it?\n\n* Opens up the product development for the whole team\n* Identifies what matters and get everyone on the team to understand the design and prioritisation. Of features \n* Provides transparency in prioritisation and strategy/vision alignment\n* Helps move the focus on the important / differentiating features\n* When used for existing products/services allows for uncovering options for pivoting\n\n## Why & How to combine it with other practices?\n\n* This practice could be used in combination with practices as [Impact Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-mapping/), Lean Canvas, Value Proposition in order to build a vision for a product/service and translate that vision into actionable and prioritized set of features.\n* The output from the practice may invoke User Research, Usability Reviews (for existing products/services)\n* It can also serve as prioritisation tool for the Product Backlog\n\n## Related Practices\n\n* [Kano Model ](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/kano-model/)\n* [Impact & Effort Matrix](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/impact-effort-prioritization-matrix/)\n* [How-Now-Wow Matrix](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/how-now-wow-prioritization-matrix/)\n* Lean Canvas\n* Value Proposition Canvas\n* User Research\n* User Interviews\n* Brainstorming\n* Product Roadmapping\n* [Design of Experiments](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/design-of-experiments/)\n\n## Origin\n\n* Ted Levitt - Whole Product Strategy\n* Dave Gray - Whole Product Game\n\n## Further information\n\nTed Levitt's article in HBR: [Marketing Success Through Differentiation—of Anything](https://hbr.org/1980/01/marketing-success-through-differentiation-of-anything)\n\n[Whole Product Game](https://gamestorming.com/whole-product-game/) on Gamestorming.com\n",

      "body": "\n## What is it?\n\nAn exercise to promote good team practice for generating lots of quality ideas.\n\n## Why use it?\n\nOften when presented with a new idea, or suggestion, our natural response is to critique that idea, to review, refine, or reject it.  \"Yes! And… \" encourages people to accept the idea as it is, and build upon it.  It can be reviewed, and refined later, and compared or combined with other ideas generated during the session.\n\nThe “Yes! And…” improv principle helps teams build on other people’s ideas. \n\nWe accept ideas without judgement. Ideas are considered as stepping stones, not judged or rejected as final products. \n\n## How to use it?\n\nBreak the group into small teams of 4–6 people.  The challenge: plan a party to celebrate last quarter’s achievements.\n\nRound 1: Everyone shares an idea (one-at-a-time). Every time one person shares an idea, someone else replies: “No, what we need to do is…” and explains the alternative idea.\n\nRound 2: Same approach. This time, the response is “Yes, but…” Everyone presents an objection and then shares their idea.\n\nRound 3: Finally, you bring up the “Yes, and…” approach. People need to build on other’s ideas by replying “yes, and we can also…”\n\nFrom https://liberationist.org/yes-and-improv/\n\n## Further Information\n\nThis is a common and widely used practice that emerged from the Theatresports community last century.
