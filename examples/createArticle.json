    "body": "## What is it?\n\nContract-First Development is about making your intent clear across team members and external teams. By using a tool like [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/), we can define our programming API clearly at the outset. We also update the \"contract\" before we implement changes to the code.\n\n![Contract-First Development](/files/contract-first-api-development.png)\n\n## Why use it?\n\nSo that everyone can be productive in parallel AND we can have strong guarantees of the resulting applications working together properly. Instead of UI development being blocked awaiting a working service to code against, UI and Service developers can work in parallel. Also, if you define the contract first when developing or changing API interfaces, you have a clearer \"Definition Of Done\" and \"Acceptance Criteria\" for the work.\n\nFurther benefits include:\n\n- Code generation for both clients and servers\n- Automated testing and validation tools\n- Simple mocking of the service under development\n- More relevant and current documentation\n\nMore tooling around OpenAPI can be found [HERE](https://openapi.tools/)",
